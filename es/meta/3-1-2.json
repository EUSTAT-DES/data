It is a measure of the health system&#x2019;s functioning and potential to provide adequate coverage for childbirth. On its own, however, this indicator does not provide insight into the availability or accessibility of services, for example in cases where emergency care is needed. Neither does this indicator capture the quality of care received.</p>\n<p>Data collection and data interpretation in many countries is challenged by lack of guidelines, standardization of professional titles and functions of the health care provider, and in some countries by task-shifting.

This is frequent in countries in the Latin America region, in European and Central Asian regions, where the proportion of births attended by health professionals is very high. Nonetheless, it should be noted that institutional births may underestimate the percentage of births assisted by skilled health professionals, particularly in cases were home births - assisted by skilled health professionals - are prevalent. </p>","OTHER_DOC__GLOBAL":"<p> </p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong> </p>","target_number":"3.1","goal_number":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-01-02"}
