Although the goals are the same, to offer a better tool to \nmeasure the statistical systems of countries, the new SPI framework has expanded into new areas \nincluding data use, administrative data, geospatial data, data services, and data infrastructure. The SPI \nprovides a framework that can help countries measure where they stand in several dimensions and offers \nan ambitious measurement agenda for the international community. \n\nThe data sources overall score (Pillar 4 score) is a composite measure of whether countries have data \navailable from the following sources: Censuses and surveys, administrative data and geospatial data. The \ndata sources (input) pillar is segmented by the following sources generated by (i) the statistical office \n(censuses and surveys), and sources accessed from elsewhere such as (ii) administrative data, and (iii) \ngeospatial data. The appropriate balance between these source types will vary depending on a \ncountry\u2019s institutional setting and the maturity of its statistical system. \n\nHigh scores should reflect the \nextent to which the sources being utilized enable the necessary statistical indicators to be generated. For \nexample, a low score on environment statistics (in the data production pillar) may reflect a lack of use of \n(and low score for) geospatial data (in the data sources pillar). \n\nOn the other hand, The Open Data Inventory (ODIN) Coverage Index is an indicator of a country\u2019s capacity to produce a set of \nofficial statistics across 22 categories from national databases to support the SDGs. \n\nComputing the total\nindex across the five elements for each of the 22 data categories allows for an assessment of the \ncountry\u2019s revealed capacity to produce data that are important for national, regional, and global \ndevelopment efforts. \n\nSource: United Nations Statistics Division \n","dato_global":"\n<a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal/analytics/SingleSeries?indicators=17.18.1&seriesCode=IQ_SPI_PIL4&areaCode=276,40,56,100,196,191,208,703,705,724,233,246,250,300,528,348,372,380,428,440,442,470,616,620,203,642,752,1,202,14,17,18,11,747,15,145,62,143,34,753,30,35,419,29,13,5,9,54,57,61,53,513,150,21,432,199,722&period=3&table=Total\">\nData Sources performance index (Statistical Performance Indicators Pillar 4) (Index) IQ_SPI_PIL4</a> UNSTATS\n\n<a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal/analytics/SingleSeries?indicators=17.18.1&seriesCode=SG_STT_ODIN&areaCode=276,40,56,100,196,191,208,703,705,724,233,246,250,300,528,348,372,380,428,440,442,470,616,620,203,642,752,1,202,14,17,18,11,747,15,145,62,143,34,753,30,35,419,29,13,5,9,54,57,61,53,513,150,21,432,199,722&period=3&table=Total\">\nOpen Data Inventory (ODIN) Coverage Index SG_STT_ODIN</a> UNSTATS\n","comparabilidad":null,"indicador_meta_enlace":"<a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-17-18-01a.pdf\">Metadata 17-18-1(a).pdf</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-17-18-01b.pdf\">Metadata 17-18-1(b).pdf</a>\n","national_data_updated_date":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"","es":{"indicador_disponible":"GRAFICO.nodisponible","definicion":null,"formula":null,"desagregacion":null,"periodicidad":null,"observaciones":null,"justificacion_global":"\nLos nuevos Indicadores de Desempe\u00f1o Estad\u00edstico (IPS) sustituyen al \n\u00cdndice de Capacidad Estad\u00edstica (ICA), que el Banco Mundial publica \nperi\u00f3dicamente desde 2004.

Credit will only be given for less than a majority of second administrative divisions if there are methodological reasons for them not to exist (sample size is too small, indicator not relevant to those divisions, or other reasons) and this is stated in the metadata of the dataset.</p>\n<p>In certain data categories, all indicators in the category are not scored at the second administrative level because administrative units responsible for producing these data do not exist in many countries or the indicators are not typically defined for small administrative units. These categories are Money &amp; Banking, International Trade, Balance of Payments, National Accounts, Government Finance, Pollution, Energy, Price Indexes, and Resource Use.</p>\n<p>In addition, the following indicators in other categories are not scored at the second administrative level for the same reasons.

They download and view all recorded datasets to confirm the information provided by the assessor and make adjustments, as necessary.</p>\n<p>NSOs are contacted at least three times by email inviting them to participate in the NSO Review process. If they accept, they are sent the results from their assessment (excluding scores). NSOs are then given one month to provide feedback on their assessment, including comments on datasets used. They are able to suggest new datasets, sources, or provide other information relevant to the assessment. During this stage, any adjustments to the assessment that result from the feedback received are completed.</p>\n<p>After the previous two rounds of review, a final review is conducted that primarily focuses on scores.
