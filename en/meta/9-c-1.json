Over the last decade, mobile-cellular networks have expanded rapidly and helped overcome very basic infrastructure barriers that existed when fixed-telephone networks &#x2013; often limited to urban and highly populated areas - were the dominant telecommunication infrastructure.</p>\n<p>While 2G (narrowband) mobile-cellular networks offer limited (and mainly voice-based) services, higher-speed networks (3G and LTE and above) provide increasingly high-speed, reliable and high-quality access to the Internet and its increasing amount of information, content, services, and applications. In addition, 5G technology offers opportunities for growth, innovation, and efficiency. To name a few examples: healthcare innovation, industrial transformation, smart infrastructure, agricultural efficiency, automotive and transformation, among others. Moreover, it has a direct impact in people development as it requires competencies as well as enhance educational experiences through high-quality online learning, virtual classrooms, and immersive educational content, making education more accessible and engaging. Mobile networks are therefore essential to overcoming infrastructure barriers, helping people join the information society and benefit from the potential of ICTs, in particular in least developed countries.</p>\n<p>The indicator highlights the importance of mobile networks in providing basic, as well as advanced communication services and will help design targeted policies to overcome remaining infrastructure barriers, and address the digital divide. Many governments track this indicator and have set specific targets in terms of the mobile population coverage (by technology) that operators must achieve.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Some countries have difficulty calculating overall mobile-cellular population coverage. In some cases, data refer only to the operator with the largest coverage, and this may understate the true coverage.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator percentage of the population covered by a mobile network, broken down by technology, refers to the percentage of inhabitants living within range of a mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they are mobile phone subscribers or users.
