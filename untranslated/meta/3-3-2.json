Known as the End TB Strategy, it covers the period 2016-2035. The overall goal is to &#x201C;End the global tuberculosis epidemic&#x201D;, and correspondingly ambitious targets for reductions in tuberculosis deaths and cases are set for 2030 (80% reduction in incidence rate compared with the level of 2015) and 2035 (90% reduction in incidence rate), in the context of the SDGs.</p>\n<p>The tuberculosis incidence rate was selected as an indicator for measuring reductions in the number of cases of disease burden. Although this indicator was estimated with considerable uncertainty in most countries in 2014, notifications of cases to national authorities provide a good proxy if there is limited under-reporting of detected cases and limited under or over-diagnosis of cases.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>TB incidence has been used for over a century as a main indicator of TB burden, along with TB mortality. The indicator allows comparisons over time and between countries. Improvement in the quality of TB surveillance data result in reduced uncertainty about indicator values.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Estimates of TB incidence are produced through a consultative and analytical process led by WHO and are published annually. These estimates are derived from annual case notifications, assessments of the quality and coverage of TB notification data, national surveys of the prevalence of TB disease, national inventory studies and information from death (vital) registration systems.</p>\n<p>For the period 2000-2019, estimates of incidence for each country are derived using one or more of the following approaches, depending on available data: (i) incidence = case notifications/estimated proportion of cases detected; (ii) capture-recapture modelling, (iii) incidence = prevalence/duration of condition.</p>\n<p>For 2020 and 2021 specifically, these methods were retained for most countries. However, for countries with large absolute reductions in the reported number of people newly diagnosed with TB in 2020 or 2021 relative to pre-2020 trends (which suggested major disruptions to access to TB diagnosis and treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic), dynamic models were used in replacement of the methods used for 2000-2019. </p>\n<p>Uncertainty bounds are provided in addition to best estimates.</p>\n<p> Details are provided in the technical appendix on methods used by WHO to estimate the global burden of tuberculosis disease published alongside the most recent WHO global tuberculosis report at <a href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/data\">https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-</a> <a href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/data\">programme/data.</a></p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Estimates of TB burden are prepared in July-August and shared with countries for review.
