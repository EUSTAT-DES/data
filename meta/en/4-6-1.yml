  Proportion of people aged 16 to 65 who have reached at least level 2 
  proficiency on the reading comprehension scale and the mathematics scale

formula: |

  $$PPN2_{c}^{t} = \frac{PN2_{16-65\,c}^{t}}{P_{16-65}^{t}}$$

  where:

  $PN2_{16-65\,c}^{t} =$ Population aged 16 to 65 who have achieved at least level 2 
  of proficiency on $c$ type of competence in the year $t$

  $P_{16-65}^{t} =$ population aged 16 to 65 in year $t$

  The Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies uses a 500-point scale to assess 
  reading comprehension and mathematics proficiency. To help interpret these scores, the scale is divided 
  into six proficiency categories:

  - Below Level 1: score below 176 
  - Level 1: score between 176 and 225 
  - Level 2: score between 226 and 275 
  - Level 3: score between 276 and 325 
  - Level 4: score between 326 and 375 
  - Level 5: score between 376 and 500 

  A person reaches at least Level 2 proficiency on the reading comprehension scale when they can usually 
  understand texts on unfamiliar topics, although they may struggle with tasks such as comparing and 
  contrasting different texts or searching for digital texts on a specific topic. 

  A person reaches at least Level 2 proficiency on the mathematics scale when they are routinely able 
  to answer questions requiring intermediate calculations, understand the mathematical information in a 
  table, and have no difficulty interpreting simple graphs, although they may have difficulty with tasks 
  such as handling proportions or interpreting complex graphs. 

  The 2012 data corresponds to the study conducted between the third quarter of 2011 and the first quarter 
  of 2012.

 # Metadatos mundiales (Descripción del indicador)  


justificacion_global: >-
  The indicator is a direct measure of the skill levels of youth and adults in the two 
  areas: literacy and numeracy. 

  The fixed level of proficiency (FLP) is the benchmark of basic knowledge in a domain 
  (literacy or numeracy) measured through learning assessments. Currently, the FLP for 
  global reporting is the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies 
  (PIAAC) level 2 descriptor. 

  The concepts of functional literacy and functional numeracy are based on the UNESCO 
  definitions, which cover a continuum of proficiency levels rather than a dichotomy. A 
  person is functionally literate if he/she can engage in all those activities in which 
  literacy is required for the effective functioning of his/her group and community and 
  also which enables them to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for his/her 
  own and the community’s development.
