  Proportion of people with income with imputed rent per unit of consumption under 60% of the median income for the autonomous community with 
  imputed rent per unit of consumption (modified OECD scale)


formula: |

  $$PPRPRAI_{CCAA}^{t} = \frac{PRPRAI_{CCAA}^{t}}{P^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $PRPRAI_{CCAA}^{t} =$ population at risk of relative poverty with imputed rent considering the poverty line of the autonomous community (60% of median income in the autonomous community with imputed rent per unit of consumption (modified OECD scale) in year $t$ 

  $P^{t} =$ total population in year $t$

  The number of consumption units in a household 
  is calculated using the modified OECD scale, which assigns a weight of 1 to the 
  first person aged 14 or over, a weight of 0.5 for other people aged 14 or over 
  and a weight of 0.3 for people under 14 years of age. 

  Imputed rent is applied to households that do not pay full rent because they own or occupy a dwelling 
  rented at below market rate or rent-free, in order to equalize rents with those that do pay full rent. 

  The imputed value is the equivalent of the market rent that would be paid for a dwelling similar to 
  the one occupied, less any rent actually paid. This variable also includes the imputed rent for the 
  dwelling when it is provided by the company where a household member works. Interest on loans taken 
  out to purchase the primary residence is also deducted from the household's total income.
