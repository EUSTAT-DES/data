justificacion_global: | 

  Paid employment is crucial for ensuring sufficient living standards and 
  it provides the necessary foundation for people to achieve their personal 
  goals and aspirations. Moreover, employment contributes to economic performance, 
  quality of life and social inclusion, making it a cornerstone of socioeconomic 
  development and well-being. 

  The European Pillar of Social Rights, jointly proclaimed by the European Commission, 
  the European Parliament and the European Council in 2017, sets out 20 key principles 
  and rights essential for fair and well-functioning labour markets and social protection 
  systems. The <a href="https://op.europa.eu/webpub/empl/european-pillar-of-social-rights/es/">
  European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan</a>, adopted in 2021, turns the 
  Principles into concrete actions to benefit citizens. It also proposes an ambitious 
  employment target of 78 % of the population aged 20 to 64 for the EU to reach by 2030. 
  In support of this, the Action Plan proposes to halve the gender employment gap by 2030 
  compared with 2019 and to decrease the rate of young people neither in employment nor in 
  education or training (NEET) aged 15 to 29 to 9 % by 2030.
