  The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda has emphasized the importance of sustainable production 
  and consumption systems as efficient food systems, on the supply side and the consumption side, 
  contribute to food security and sustainability of natural resource since agriculture is a major 
  user of land and water. 

  The food loss and food waste index look at the entire supply chain and the trend in structural 
  losses. The Food Loss Index monitors progress on the supply side of food chains, as it measures 
  if the share of agriculture production that does not reach the retail stage in 2030 has increased 
  or decreased with respect to the base period and by how much. The numerator of the indicator 
  indicates the level of losses and informs on the magnitude of the problem. 

  A greater efficiency of the food supply chain also has implications for all producers whether 
  looking at efficiency in large-scale producers for export markets or in small-scale production 
  units relevant for poverty and food insecurity reduction goals. 

  According to a 2011 FAO publication, approximately one-third of all food is lost or wasted. This 
  generates economic losses and increases pressure on food systems. Reducing food waste is critical 
  to maximizing the value of agricultural land and ensuring that natural resources are used sustainably. 
  This indicator will not only help countries identify where food is lost and wasted, but can also 
  provide information that governments, citizens, and the private sector can use to reduce food waste.
