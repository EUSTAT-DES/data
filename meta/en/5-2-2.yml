justificacion_global: |
  Violence against women and girls is one of the most pervasive forms of human rights 
  violations in the world. Evidence has shown that globally, an estimated 7% of women 
  have been sexually assaulted by someone other than a partner at some point in their 
  lives (WHO et al., 2013). 

  Having data on this indicator will help understand the extent and nature of this 
  form of violence and develop appropriate policies and programmes.
