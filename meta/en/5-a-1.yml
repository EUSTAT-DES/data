  Proportion of heads of agricultural holdings, to the total number of agricultural workers and 
  proportion of female heads of agricultural holdings to the total number of heads of agricultural 
  holdings, by type of tenure. 

formula: |

  <b>Proportion of heads of agricultural holdings, to the total number of agricultural workers</b>

  $$PPOA_{head}^{t} = \frac{TEA^{t}}{POA^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $TEA^{t} =$ heads of agricultural holdings in year $t$

  $POA^{t} =$ people employed in agriculture in year $t$

  <br>

  <b>proportion of female heads of agricultural holdings to the total number of heads of agricultural 
  holdings, by type of tenure</b>

  $$PTEA_{women}^{t} = \frac{TEA_{women}^{t}}{TEA^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $TEA_{women}^{t} =$ female heads of agricultural holdings in year $t$ by type of tenure

  $TEA^{t} =$ heads of agricultural holdings in year $t$ by type of tenure

  Sub-indicator 5.a.1 (a) is a prevalence measure. It measures the prevalence of people 
  in the agricultural population with ownership or secure rights over agricultural land, disaggregated by sex. 

  Sub-indicator 5.a.1 (b) focuses on gender parity, measuring the extent to which women are disadvantaged 
  in ownership or secure rights over agricultural land.

justificacion_global: |

  Indicator 5.a.1 aims to monitor the gender balance on ownership/secure rights over agricultural land. 
  Subindicator (a) and sub-indicator (b) are based on the same data and they monitor ownership/rights from 
  two different angles. 

  While sub-indicator (a) uses the total male/female agricultural population as reference population, 
  and it tells us how many male/female own land, sub-indicator (b) focuses on the agricultural population 
  with land ownership/secure rights, and it tells us how many of them are women.
