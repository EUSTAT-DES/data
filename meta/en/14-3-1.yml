  The ocean absorbs up to 30% of the annual emissions of anthropogenic CO2 to the atmosphere, helping 
  to alleviate the impacts of climate change on the planet. However, this comes at a steep ecological cost, 
  as the absorbed CO2 reacts with seawater and results in shifts in the dissolved carbonate chemistry 
  including increased acidity levels in the marine environment (decreased seawater pH). 

  Ocean acidification has potentially direct consequences for marine life and cascades through to the 
  services provided by the open ocean and coastal areas including food and livelihood, tourism, coastal 
  protection, cultural identity, transportation and recreation. The impacts on ocean services from ocean 
  acidification may be lessened through appropriate monitoring and improved understanding of variability 
  and rates of change, helping to inform mitigation and/or adaptation strategies.
