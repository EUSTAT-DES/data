definicion: |
  Area of ​​potentially contaminated soils recovered for new uses, accumulated since 2005 
  and percentage with respect to the potentially contaminated area. 

  A soil is considered to have been recovered if it has a Declaration of Soil Quality 
  as provided for in Law 4/2015, of June 25, for the prevention and correction of soil 
  contamination. 

formula: |

  $$PSPC_{recovered}^{t} = \frac{SPC_{recovered}^{t}}{SPC^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where: 

  $SPC_{recovered}^{t} =$ area of ​​potentially contaminated soils recovered for new uses from 2005 to year $t$

  $SPC^{t} =$ area of ​​potentially contaminated soils in year $t$

justificacion_global: |
  Land degradation is defined as the reduction or loss of the biological or economic productivity and 
  complexity of rain fed cropland, irrigated cropland, or range, pasture, forest and woodlands resulting 
  from a combination of pressures, including land use and management practices. 

  SDG indicator 15.3.1 is a binary - degraded/not degraded - quantification based on the analysis of 
  available data for three sub-indicators: Trends in Land Cover, Land Productivity and Carbon Stocks.
