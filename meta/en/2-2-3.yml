  Anaemia is highly prevalent globally, disproportionately affecting 
  children and women of reproductive age. It negatively affects cognitive 
  and motor development and work capacity, and among pregnant women iron 
  deficiency anaemia is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes, including 
  preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the 
  baby, which may lead to impaired development.

  Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia, but there 
  are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes. Blood haemoglobin concentrations 
  are affected by many factors, including altitude (metres above sea level), 
  smoking, trimester of pregnancy, age and sex.

  Anaemia can be assessed by measuring blood haemoglobin, and when used in 
  combination with other indicators of iron status, blood haemoglobin provides 
  information about the severity of iron deficiency. The anaemia prevalence for 
  the population is used to classify the public health significance of the problem.
