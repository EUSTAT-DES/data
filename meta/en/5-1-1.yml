  Equality and non-discrimination based on sex are core principles under 
  the international legal and policy framework, including the Convention 
  on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), 
  which has 189 States parties, and the Beijing Platform for Action. This 
  framework sets out the commitments of States to eliminate discrimination 
  against women and promote gender equality, including in the area of legal 
  frameworks. 

  In the Beijing Platform for Action, States pledged to revoke any remaining 
  laws that discriminate based on sex. The five-year review and appraisal of 
  the Beijing Platform for Action (Beijing +5) established 2005 as the target 
  date for the repeal of laws that discriminate against women. This deadline 
  has come and gone. While there has been progress in reforming laws to promote 
  gender equality, discrimination against women in the law continues in many 
  countries. Even where legal reforms have taken place, gaps in implementation 
  persist. 

  Removing discriminatory laws and putting in place legal frameworks that advance 
  gender equality are prerequisites to ending discrimination against women and 
  achieving gender equality (Goal 5, Target 5.1). Indicator 5.1.1 will be crucial 
  in accelerating progress on the implementation of SDG 5 and all other gender-related 
  commitments in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 

  Indicator 5.1.1 measures Government efforts to put in place legal frameworks that 
  promote, enforce and monitor gender equality. 

  The assessment is carried out by national counterparts, including National Statistical 
  Offices (NSOs) and/or National Women’s Machinery (NWMs), and legal practitioners/
  researchers on gender equality, using a questionnaire comprising 42 yes/no questions 
  under four areas of law: 

   (i) overarching legal frameworks and public life<br>  
   (ii) violence against women<br>  
   (iii) employment and economic benefits<br>  
   (iv) marriage and family<br>  

  The areas of law and questions are drawn from the international legal and policy 
  framework on gender equality, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All 
  Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which has 189 States parties, and the 
  Beijing Platform for Action. 

  The primary sources of information relevant for indicator 5.1.1 are legislation and 
  policy/action plans.
