  Births to mothers aged 10-14 years and 15-19 year per 1.000 women in these age groups

formula: |

  $$TF_{age\, group}^{t} = \frac{N_{age\, group}^{t}}{P_{women\, age\, group}^{t}} \cdot 1.000$$

  where:

  $N_{age\, group}^{t} =$ births to mothers in age group in year $t$

  $P_{women\, age\, group}^{t} =$ women in age group as of 1 July in year $t$

  Reducing adolescent fertility and addressing the multiple factors underlying it are essential 
  for improving sexual and reproductive health and the social and economic well-being of adolescents. 
  There is substantial agreement in the literature that women who become pregnant and give birth 
  very early in their reproductive lives are subject to higher risks of complications or even death 
  during pregnancy and birth and their children are also more vulnerable. Therefore, preventing births 
  very early in a woman’s life is an important measure to improve maternal health and reduce infant 
  mortality.

  Furthermore, women having children at an early age experience reduced opportunities for socioeconomic 
  advancement, particularly because young mothers are less likely to complete their education and, if they 
  need to work, may find it especially difficult to combine family and work responsibilities. The 
  adolescent birth rate also provides indirect evidence on access to pertinent health services since young 
  people, and in particular unmarried adolescent women, often experience difficulties in access to sexual 
  and reproductive health services.
