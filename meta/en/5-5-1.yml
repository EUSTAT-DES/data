justificacion_global: |

  The indicator measures the degree to which women have equal access to parliamentary decision-making. 
  Women’s participation in parliaments is a key aspect of women’s opportunities in political and public 
  life and is linked to women’s empowerment. Equal numbers of women and men in lower chambers would 
  give an indicator value of 50 percent. 

  A stronger presence of women in parliament allows new concerns to be highlighted on political agendas, 
  and new priorities to be put into practice through the adoption and implementation of policies and laws. 
  The inclusion of the perspectives and interests of women is a prerequisite for democracy and gender 
  equality and contributes to good governance. A representative parliament also allows the different 
  experiences of men and women to affect the social, political, and economic future of societies. 

  Although the international community has supported and promoted women’s participation in political 
  decision-making structures for several decades, improvement in women’s access to parliament has been 
  slow. This has led to the introduction of special policies and legal measures to increase women’s 
  shares of parliamentary seats in several countries. Those countries that have adopted special measures 
  generally have greater representation of women in parliament than countries without special measures. 

  Indicator 5.5.1(b) complements Indicator 5.5.1(a) on women in national parliaments, and accounts for the 
  representation of women among the millions of members of local governments that influence (or have the 
  potential to influence) the lives of local communities around the world. All tiers of local government are 
  covered by the indicator, consistent with national legal frameworks defining local government.
