definicion: >- 
  Average annualized growth rate over a five-year period of income and expenditure per 
  capita of households in the poorest 40% of the population of the autonomous community 
  (40% of people with the lowest income per consumption unit (modified OECD scale)) and 
  of the total population.


formula: |

  The annualized growth in average real per capita income or consumption is calculated by 
  first estimating the average real per capita income or consumption of the bottom 40% of 
  the welfare distribution in years T0 and T1 and then calculating the average annual growth 
  rate between those years using a compound growth formula: 

  Crecimiento del ingreso o consumo = $$\left( \frac{Average\, T_1}{Average\, T_0} \right)^{\frac{1}{T_1 - T_0}} - 1$$


  The growth in average real per capita income or consumption of the total population is 
  calculated in the same way using data for the total population.

  Improvements in shared prosperity require both a growing economy and a consideration 
  of equity. Shared prosperity explicitly recognizes that while growth is necessary for 
  improving economic welfare in a society, progress is measured by how those gains are 
  shared with its poorest members.  

  Moreover, in an inclusive society it is not sufficient to raise everyone above an 
  absolute minimum standard of living; it must ensure that economic growth increases 
  prosperity among the poor over time. 

  The decision to measure shared prosperity based on income or consumption was not taken 
  to ignore the many other dimensions of welfare. It is motivated by the need for an 
  indicator that is easy to understand, communicate, and measure – though measurement 
  challenges exist. Indeed, shared prosperity comprises many dimensions of well-being 
  of the less well-off, and when analyzing shared prosperity in the context of a country, 
  it is important to consider a wide range of indicators of welfare.
