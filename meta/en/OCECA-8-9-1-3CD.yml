  $$PGVCORV^{t} = \frac{GVC_{national}^{t}+GVC_{foreign}^{t}}{GVORV_{national}^{t} + GVORV_{foreign}^{t}} \cdot 100 $$ 

  where: 

  $GVC_{national}^{t} =$ expenditure on cultural trips by national tourists in year $t$ 

  $GVC_{foreign}^{t} =$ expenditure on cultural trips by foreign tourists in year $t$

  $GVORV_{national}^{t} =$ expenditure on leisure, recreation, and vacation trips by national tourists in year $t$

  $GVORV_{foreign}^{t} =$ expenditure on leisure, recreation, and vacation trips by foreign tourists in year $t$

  <b>Proportion of spending on cultural trips over travel spending</b>

  $$PGVC^{t} = \frac{GVC_{national}^{t}+GVC_{foreign}^{t}}{GV_{national}^{t} + GV_{foreign}^{t}} \cdot 100 $$

  where: 

  $GVC_{national}^{t}$ expenditure on cultural trips by national tourists in year $t$ 

  $GVC_{foreign}^{t}$ expenditure on cultural trips by foreign tourists in year $t$

  $GV_{national}^{t}$ expenditure on trips by national tourists in year $t$
