definicion: >-

  Proportion of people who are in at least one of the three situations of risk of poverty or social 
  exclusion: at risk of relative poverty (considering the national poverty line), living in households 
  with severe material deprivation or living in households with low work intensity 


formula: |
  $$AROPE_{NAC}^{t} = \frac{PRPES_{NAC}^{t}}{P^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $PRPES_{NAC}^{t} =$ population at risk of poverty or social exclusion in year $t$, considering the national poverty line 

  $P^{t} =$ total population in year $t$

periodicidad: FUENTE.FREQ_A2

  The indicator measures the proportion of people who meet at least one of the following criteria:

  <b>People at risk of relative poverty:</b> people with income per consumption unit below 60% of the median (modified OECD scale) 

  The number of consumption units in a household 
  is calculated using the modified OECD scale, which assigns a weight of 1 to the 
  first person aged 14 or over, a weight of 0.5 for other people aged 14 or over 
  and a weight of 0.3 for people under 14 years of age. 

  <b>People in situations of severe material and social deprivation:</b> people who suffer from at least seven 
  of the following list of thirteen limitations (seven defined at the household level and six at the individual level): 

  At the household level:
   1. You can't afford to go on vacation for at least one week a year.
   2. You cannot afford a meal of meat, chicken or fish at least every other day.
   3. You cannot afford to keep the home at an adequate temperature.
   4. You do not have the capacity to face unforeseen expenses.
   5. You have had delays in the payment of expenses related to the main home (mortgage or rent, gas bills, community...) 
   or in installment purchases in the last 12 months.
   6. You can't afford a car.
   7. You cannot replace damaged or old furniture.

  At the individual level:
   8. You cannot afford to replace damaged clothes with new ones.
   9. You can't afford to have two pairs of shoes in good condition.
   10. You can't afford to meet friends/family for food or drinks at least once a month.
   11. You cannot afford to regularly participate in leisure activities.
   12. You can't afford to spend a small amount of money on yourself.
   13. Cannot afford internet connection.

  In the case of minors under 16 years of age, the six concepts listed above are not available at the individual level. 
  For these minors, the values of these elements are imputed from the values collected for the members of their household aged 16 or over. 

  <b>Low work intensity:</b> these are households in which their working age members (people from 18 to 64 years old, excluding 
  students from 18 to 24 years old, retirees or retirees, as well as inactive people between 60 and 64 whose main source of household income 
  are pensions) worked less than 20% of their total work potential during the reference year. 
  This variable does not apply for people aged 65 and over. 

  Data from 2022 onwards for the AROPE Poverty and Exclusion Indicator are calculated using the new definition of the rate (Eurostat 
  methodology from 2021), while previous data correspond to the old definition.
