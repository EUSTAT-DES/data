definicion: |

  Proportion of local administrative units (municipalities) with established and operational policies 
  and procedures for participation of local communities in drinking water and sanitation management 
  and in bathing water management
   

formula: |

  $$PDAL_{water\, management}^{t} = \frac{DAL_{water\, management}^{t}}{DAL^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $DAL_{water\, management}^{t} =$ local administrative units (municipalities) with established and operational policies 
  and procedures for participation of local communities in water management in year $t$

  $DAL^{t} =$ local administrative units (municipalities) in year $t$

  The indicator is 100% since local governments are responsible for the quality of drinking water, 
  and can manage its supply directly or through a manager (Royal Decree 140/2003, of February 7, 
  establishing the health criteria for the quality of drinking water). They are also responsible for 
  the management of bathing water (Royal Decree 1341/2007, of October 11, on the management of bathing 
  water quality).

justificacion_global: | 

  Defining the procedures in policy or law for the participation of local communities is vital 
  to ensure the needs of all the community are met, including the most vulnerable and also encourages 
  ownership of schemes which in turn contributes to their sustainability. 

  A low value of this indicator would suggest that participation of local communities in water and 
  sanitation management is low, whereas a high value would indicate high levels of participation, 
  indicating greater ownership and a higher likelihood of sustainable delivery and management of 
  water and sanitation services.
