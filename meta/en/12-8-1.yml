  In order to achieve SDG targets 4.7, 12.8 and 13.3, it is necessary for governments 
  to ensure that ESD and GCED and their sub-themes are fully integrated in all aspects 
  of their education systems. 

  Students will not achieve the desired learning outcomes if Education for Sustainable 
  Development (ESD) and Global Citizenship Education (GCED) have not been identified 
  as priorities in education policies or laws, if curricula do not specifically include 
  the themes and sub-themes of ESD and GCED, and if teachers are not trained to teach 
  these topics across the curriculum. 

  This indicator aims to give a simple assessment of whether the basic infrastructure 
  exists that would allow countries to deliver quality ESD and GCED to learners, to 
  ensure their populations have adequate information on sustainable development and 
  lifestyles in harmony with nature. Appropriate education policies, curricula, teacher 
  education, and student assessment are key aspects of national commitment and effort to 
  implement GCED and ESD effectively and to provide a conducive learning environment.
