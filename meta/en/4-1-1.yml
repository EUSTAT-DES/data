  Proportion of 15-year-olds who have achieved at least level 2 proficiency 
  in i) reading and ii) mathematics, by sex 


formula: |

  $$PPN2_{proficiency}^{t} = \frac{PN2_{proficiency}^{t}}{P_{15}^{t}}$$

  where:

  $PN2_{proficiency}^{t} =$ 15-year-old population that has reached at least level 2 
  proficiency in the subject in year $t$

  $P_{15}^{t} =$ population aged 15 in year $t$

  The Programme for International Student Assessment uses a scoring system with 
  no minimum or maximum score. The results are scaled to fit a normal distribution 
  with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. To aid in the interpretation 
  of these scores, reading proficiency categories are established: 

  - Below Level 1c: score below 189.33
  - Level 1c: score between 189.33 and 262.03
  - Level 1b: score between 262.04 and 334.74
  - Level 1a: score between 334.75 and 407.46
  - Level 2: score between 407.47 and 480.17
  - Level 3: score between 480.18 and 552.88
  - Level 4: score between 552.89 and 625.60
  - Level 5: score between 625.61 and 698.31
  - Level 6: score above 698.31


  A person reaches at least Level 2 reading proficiency when, for a text of average length, 
  he or she can identify the main idea, understand the relationships between its parts, 
  interpret the meaning of a limited part of the text through basic inferences, locate one 
  or more pieces of information according to multiple partially implicit criteria, reflect 
  on the general or specific purpose of the text, compare statements and evaluate the reasoning 
  on which they are based by establishing connections between the text and external knowledge.

  The following proficiency categories are established in mathematics:

  - Below Level 1: score below 357.77 
  - Level 1: score between 357.77 and 420.06
  - Level 2: score between 420.07 and 482.37
  - Level 3: score between 482.38 and 544.67
  - Level 4: score between 544.68 and 606.98
  - Level 5: score between 606.99 and 669.29
  - Level 6: score above 669.29 

  An individual achieves at least Level 2 proficiency in mathematics when he or she can interpret 
  and recognize situations in contexts that only require direct inference, extract relevant information 
  from a single source and make use of a single mode of representation, use elementary algorithms, 
  formulas, procedures or conventions to solve problems related to integers and carry out direct reasoning 
  and literal interpretations of the results.

 # Metadatos mundiales (Descripción del indicador)  


justificacion_global: |
  The indicator aims to measure the percentage of children and young people who have achieved the 
  minimum learning outcomes in reading and mathematics during or at the end of the relevant stages of 
  education. The higher the figure, the higher the proportion of children and/or young people reaching 
  at least minimum proficiency in the respective domain (reading or mathematic). 

  Learning outcomes from cross-national learning assessment are directly comparable for all countries 
  which participated in the same cross-national learning assessments.
