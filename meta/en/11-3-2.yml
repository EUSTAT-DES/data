justificacion_global: | 

  This indicator measures the progress and willingness of elected officials, 
  urban managers and planners to integrate resident and civil society participation 
  in urban planning and management at various levels. Local authorities and governments, 
  along with the international community, are increasingly recognizing the value of 
  civil society and residents’ participation in strengthening the urban development 
  processes. 

  This people-centered approach is key in guiding urban development processes for 
  local ownership, and the implementation of community projects at citywide or local levels. 

  Civil society and public participation fosters a positive relationship between 
  government and the public by communicating effectively and solving the conflicts in a 
  cooperative manner. In many cases when urban planning decisions are made without 
  consultation, the desired results are not achieved and there is a negative impact 
  on society, due to inefficient allocation and use of resources. Ensuring that wide 
  varieties of opinions are considered assists the decision makers with understanding 
  the interlinkages and nature of problems and potential solutions facing different 
  urban settings.
