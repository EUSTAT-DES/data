justificacion_global: |
  A health workforce of adequate size and skill mix, as well as required teachers and trainers, 
  are critical to the attainment of any population health goal. This includes the achievement 
  of universal health coverage and the health-related targets of the United Nations Sustainable 
  Development Goals.

  Yet countries globally are affected by health workforce challenges of a multifaceted nature, 
  such as difficulties in the education and training, deployment, performance and retention of 
  their health workforces. A suboptimal allocation of health workers is one of the main challenges 
  that directly influences the availability, accessibility, quality and performance of national 
  health services. In the worst case, this may leave populations with inadequate access to the 
  health services they need. It is clear that efforts to achieve the SDGs and UHC are thwarted by 
  these health workforce challenges.

  Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners developed the Global Strategy 
  on Human Resources for Health: Workforce 2030 (GSHRH), which sets out the policy agenda to ensure 
  a health workforce that is fit for purpose to attain the targets of UHC and the SDGs (WHO 2016c).
