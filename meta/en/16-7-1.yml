  The indicator is composed of several series:

  <b> - Proportion of women in parliament relative to the proportion of women in the population:</b>
    Ratio of the proportion of women in the regional parliament relative to the proportion of women in the population aged 16 to 64
  
  <b> - Proportion of women in public administration relative to the proportion of women in the population:</b>
    Ratio of the proportion of women in the public sector to the proportion of women in the population aged 16 to 64, by public institution

  <b> - Proportion of women in the judiciary relative to the proportion of women in the population:</b>
    Ratio of the proportion of women among active judges and magistrates relative to the proportion of women in the population aged 16 to 64


formula: |

  $$RM_{SP}^{t} = \frac{PM_{SP}^{t}}{PM_{16-64}^{t}}$$

  being:

  $$PM_{SP}^{t} = \frac{P_{SP\, women}^{t}}{P_{SP}^{t}} \cdot 100 $$

  $$PM_{16-64}^{t} = \frac{P_{16-64\, women}^{t}}{P_{16-64}^{t}} \cdot 100 $$

  where: 

  $P_{SP\, women}^{t} =$ women in service of the institution corresponding as of January 1 of year $t$ 

  $P_{SP}^{t} =$ people in service of the institution corresponding as of January 1 of year $t$ 

  $P_{16-64\, women}^{t} =$ women aged 16-64 as of 1 January of year $t$ 

  $P_{16-64}^{t} =$ people aged 16-64 as of 1 January of year $t$

  The reference value of this indicator is 1, which means the representation of women in the institution 
  analyzed is perfectly proportional to their presence in the population between 16 
  and 64 years old. 

  If the indicator takes a value less than 1 it means that women are underrepresented, while if it 
  takes a value greater than 1 it means that they are overrepresented.

justificacion_global: |
  The public service is the bedrock of government – where the development and implementation of public 
  policies and programmes takes place and where society interacts with the government. In most countries, 
  the public service is also the single largest employer. It is in this context that SDG 16, under its target 16.7, 
  encourages countries to ensure that the public service is representative of the people it serves “at all 
  levels”. 

  Indicator 16.7.1 focuses on proportional representation in public institutions; it measures the extent to 
  which a country’s public institutions are representative of the general population. Proportional 
  representation (also known as ‘descriptive representation’) in the public service is concerned with the 
  extent to which the composition of the public service mirrors the various socio-demographic groups in the 
  national population. The underlying assumption is that when the public service reflects the social diversity 
  of a nation, this may lead to greater legitimacy of the public service in the eyes of citizens, as public servants 
  resemble the people they provide services to.  

  Proportional representation has been found to be associated
  with higher levels of trust in public institutions, as people perceive more inclusive policymaking processes 
  to improve the quality and fairness of policy decisions, and to help curb the undue influence of vested 
  interests over decision-making.
