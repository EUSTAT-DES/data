definicion:  | 
  Domestic material consumption (DMC), or internal material consumption, 
  is a standard material flow accounting (MFA) indicator and reports the 
  apparent consumption of materials in the Basque Country economy. 

  DMC measures the total amount of material (biomass, fossil fuels, metallic 
  minerals, and non-metallic minerals) directly used in an economy and is based 
  on direct material flow accounts, i.e., domestic material extraction, and physical imports
  and exports. 

  Data are presented in absolute terms, per capita, and per unit of GDP. 


formula:  |
  <b>Domestic material consumption</b>

  $$CDM^t = Extr^t + Imp^t - Exp^t$$

  where:

  $Extr^t =$ domestic extraction of materials in year $t$

  $Imp^t =$ imports in year $t$

  $Exp^t =$ exports in year $t$

  <br>

  <b>Domestic material consumption per capita</b>

  $$CMDPC^{t} = \frac{{CMD^{t}}}{P^{t}}$$

  where:

  $CMD^{t} =$ domestic material consumption in year $t$

  $P^{t} =$ population as of 1 July of year $t$

  <br>

  <b>Domestic material consumption per unit of GDP</b>

  $$CMDPIB^{t} = \frac{{CMD^{t}}}{PIB_{2022}^{t}}$$

  where:

  $CMD^{t} =$ domestic material consumption in year $t$

  $PIB_{2022}^{t} =$ Gross domestic product in chained volumes with reference to 2022
  in millions of euros for the year $t$

justificacion_global: | 

  Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) reports the amount of materials that are used 
  in a national economy. It is a territorial (production side) indicator. 

  DMC also presents the amount of material that needs to be handled within an economy, 
  which is either added to material stocks of buildings and transport infrastructure 
  or used to fuel the economy as material throughput. 
 
  Per-capita DMC describes the average level of material use in an economy – an 
  environmental pressure indicator – and is also referred to as metabolic profile.
