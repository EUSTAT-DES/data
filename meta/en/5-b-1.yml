  Mobile phone networks have spread rapidly over the last decade and the number 
  of mobile-cellular subscriptions is quasi equal to the number of people living 
  on earth. However, not every person uses or owns a mobile-cellular telephone. 
  Mobile phone ownership, in particular, is important to track gender equality 
  since the mobile phone is a personal device that, if owned and not just shared, 
  provides women with a degree of independence and autonomy, including for professional 
  purposes. Several studies have highlighted the link between mobile phone ownership and 
  empowerment, and productivity growth. 

  Existing data on the proportion of women owning a mobile phone suggest that fewer 
  women than men own a mobile phone. This indicator highlights the importance of mobile 
  phone ownership to track and improve gender equality, and monitoring will help design 
  targeted policies to overcome the gender divide.
