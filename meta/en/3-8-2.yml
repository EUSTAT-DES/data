  $$PPGGS_{\gt x\%}^{t} = \frac{PGGS_{\gt x\%}^{t}}{P^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $PGGS_{\gt x\%}^{t} =$ population who live in households with large expenditures on health, greater than $x\%$ of total household expenditure, in year,  $t$

  $P^{t} =$ total population in year $t$

justificacion_global: |

  The indicator measures the proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a 
  share of total household expenditure or income. Two thresholds are used to define “large household 
  expenditure on health”: greater than 10% and greater than 25% of total household expenditure or income.

  Target 3.8 is about universal health coverage (UHC) and is defined as “Achieve universal health coverage, 
  including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, 
  effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all”. 

  The concern is with all people and communities receiving the quality health services they need (including 
  medicines and other health products) without financial hardship. Financial hardship is a key consequence 
  of inadequate financial risk protection mechanisms and can be experienced in any country, regardless of the 
  income level and type of health system.

  Indicator 3.8.2 is about identifying people with out-of-pocket health spending on health exceeding their 
  ability to pay, which might lead to cutting spending on other basic needs such as education, food, housing 
  and utilities.

  Reducing financial hardship in health is important on the global development agenda as well as a priority 
  of the health sector of many countries across all regions.
