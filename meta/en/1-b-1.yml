  The indicator measures the extent to which public spending in three key areas which 
  are critical for poverty eradication, including health, education, and other direct 
  transfers is directly allocated to individuals or households in the monetary poor 
  as per the national definition. 
  
  The indicator measures if public spending is targeting the monetary poor. Pro-poor 
  social spending is defined if the proportion of government expenditures on social 
  services is higher than the proportion of the population, measured at the level determined 
  by national definition of income/consumption poverty (consistent with SDG 1.2.1). For instance, 
  if the proportion of public spending received by the poor exceeds (falls below) the proportion 
  of poor as defined by national definitions, public expenditures can be interpreted as pro-poor 
  (not pro-poor). This is a strong measurement of the financial commitment governments make to 
  target their services and transfers on the poor groups of society, reinforcing propoor 
  development strategies. 
  
  Further developments of the methodology and improvements in data availability may allow to expand
  this indicator to other vulnerable groups, such as women and children.
