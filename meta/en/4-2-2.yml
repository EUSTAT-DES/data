justificacion_global: |

  The participation rate in organized learning (one year before the official 
  primary entry age), by sex is defined as the percentage of children in the 
  given age range who participate in one or more organized learning programme, 
  including programmes which offer a combination of education and care. 
  Participation in early childhood and in primary education are both included. 
  The age range will vary by country depending on the official age of entry to 
  primary education.

  The indicator measures children’s exposure to organized learning activities 
  in the year prior to the start of primary school. A high value of the indicator 
  shows a high degree of participation in organized learning immediately before 
  the official entrance age to primary education.
