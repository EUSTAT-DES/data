justificacion_global: |

  While the private sector has a critical role to play in the attainment of the 
  SDGs, Target 12.6 and Indicator 12.6.1 are the only ones specifically monitoring 
  the practices of private sector entities. 

  While Indicator 12.6.1 counts the number of companies producing “sustainability 
  reports”, the custodian agencies consider the indicator an important opportunity 
  not only to monitor and promote the growth in sustainability reporting globally, 
  but also to monitor and promote high quality reporting, promote the integration 
  of sustainability information into the annual reporting cycle of companies, and 
  promote sustainability practices by companies (as mentioned in the Target under 
  which the indicator falls). 

  EMAS is a voluntary instrument of the European Union that helps organisations of any size 
  and in any sector to continuously improve their environmental performance. Having EMAS 
  certification does not automatically mean that organisations or their products are 
  more environmentally friendly than comparable organisations and products. EMAS 
  involves a reporting obligation requiring organisations to submit environmental statements. 
  These statements include reporting on the main environmental impacts of the organisation 
  in question as well as data pertaining to energy and material efficiency, emissions, water, 
  waste and use of land/biodiversity.

  The EU Ecolabel is a voluntary scheme promoting goods and services that clearly demonstrate 
  environmental excellence, based on standardised processes and scientific evidence. EU Ecolabel is the only 
  EU-wide ISO 14024 Type I ecolabelling scheme. Recognised throughout Europe, it is multi-criteria 
  and tackles the main environmental impacts of products along their full lifecycle, from extraction 
  of raw material to disposal. The EU Ecolabel is third-party verified, which means independent 
  experts are responsible for checking compliance with the EU Ecolabel criteria.
