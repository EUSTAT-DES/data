  Proportion of people with income per consumption unit below 60% of the median of the Basque Autonomous Community (modified OECD scale)

formula: |

  $$PP_{RPR}^{t} = \frac{P_{RPR}^{t}}{P^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $P_{RPR}^{t} =$ population with income below 60% of median income per unit of consumption (modified OECD scale) in year $t$

  $P^{t} =$ total population in year $t$

  is calculated using the modified OECD scale, which assigns a weight of 1 to the 
  first person aged 14 or over, a weight of 0.5 for other people aged 14 or over

justificacion_global: |

  The At-Risk-of-Poverty Rate or monetary poverty is one of the key indicators 
  for monitoring poverty in the European Union.

  This indicator measures neither wealth nor poverty, but low income in comparison with other residents of the territory, 
  which does not necessarily imply a low standard of living.

  The at-risk-of-poverty rate is the proportion of people 
  with an equivalent disposable income (after social transfers) below the 
  at-risk-of-poverty threshold, which is set by convention in the EU in the 
  60% of the median equivalent disposable income after social transfers 
  in a territory.

  To account for the impact of differences in household size and composition, 
  a household's disposable income (total income, after taxes and other deductions, which is 
  available to spend or save) is divided by the number of household members converted into adult 
  equivalents (units of consumption). In the EU, an equivalence factor calculated according to 
  the modified OECD scale proposed in 1994 is applied.
