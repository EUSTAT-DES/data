definicion: |

  Gross Value Added (VAB) of agriculture, livestock and fishing with respect to the GVA 
  of the total sectors, at current prices.

  Agricultural value added and GDP are based on the European System of Accounts (ESA-2010). 
  Agriculture refers to the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting sectors (Section A of 
  the CNAE 2009 or ISIC Rev4).

 
formula: |

  $$PVAB_{agriculture}^{t} = \frac{VAB_{agriculture}^{t}}{PIB^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $VAB_{agriculture}^{t} =$ gross added value of the agriculture, livestock and fishing sector at current prices in the year $t$

  $PIB^{t} =$ gross domestic product at current prices in the year $t$

  An Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) greater than 1 reflects a higher orientation towards the agriculture 
  sector, which receives a higher share of government spending relative to its contribution to economic 
  value-added.

  An AOI less than 1 reflects a lower orientation to agriculture, while an AOI equal to 1 
  reflects neutrality in a government’s orientation to the agriculture sector. 

  Government spending in agriculture includes spending on sector policies and programs; soil improvement 
  and soil degradation control; irrigation and reservoirs for agricultural use; animal health management, 
  livestock research and training in animal husbandry; marine/freshwater biological research; afforestation 
  and other forestry projects; etc.

  Spending in these agricultural activities helps to increase sector efficiency, productivity and income 
  growth by increasing physical or human capital and/or reducing inter-temporal budget constraints. 

  However, the private sector typically under-invests in these activities due to the presence of market 
  failure (e.g. the public good nature of research and development; the positive externalities from 
  improved soil and water conditions; lack of access to competitive credit due to asymmetric information 
  between producers and financial institutions, etc.). 

  Similarly, the high risk faced by agricultural producers, particular smallholders unable to hedge 
  against risk, often requires government intervention in terms of income redistribution to support 
  smallholders in distress following crop failures and livestock loss from pests, droughts, floods, 
  infrastructure failure, or severe price changes.
