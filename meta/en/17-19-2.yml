justificacion_global: |

  Population and housing censuses are one of the primary sources of data needed for formulating, 
  implementing and monitoring policies and programmes aimed at inclusive socioeconomic development 
  and environmental sustainability. Population and housing censuses are an important source for supplying 
  disaggregated data needed for the measurement of progress of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
  Development, especially in the context of assessing the situation of people by income, sex, age, race, 
  ethnicity, migratory status, disability and geographic location, or other characteristics. 

  The introduction of indicator 17.19.2b as part of the SDG global framework reflects the recognition of the 
  fundamental role of the civil registration system to the functioning of societies, and the legal and 
  protective advantages that it offers to individuals. 

  The essential purpose of civil registration system is to 
  furnish legal documents of direct interest to individuals. Aside from the direct and overarching 
  importance of civil registration to the public authorities, in that the information compiled using the 
  registration method provides essential data for national and regional preparation and planning for 
  medical and health-care programmes, the role played by civil registration in proving, establishing, 
  implementing and realizing many of the human rights embodied in international declarations and 
  conventions reflects one of its most important contributions to the normal functioning of societies.
