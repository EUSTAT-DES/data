  Ammonia emissions ($NH_3$) from agriculture and livestock

formula: |

  $$ENH3_{agriculture\, y\, livestock}^{t} = ENH3_{agriculture}^{t} + ENH3_{livestock}^{t}$$

  where: 

  $ENH3_{agriculture}^{t}$ $NH_3$ emmisions from agriculture in the year $t$

  $ENH3_{livestock}^{t}$ $NH_3$ emmisions from livestock in the year $t$

justificacion_global: |
  The indicator is part of the EU Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicator set. 
  It is used to monitor progress towards SDG 2 on ending hunger and malnutrition and is 
  integrated into the European Commission's priorities within the framework of the European Green Deal.

  The indicator measures ammonia (NH3) emissions as a result of agricultural production. 
  These emissions result from manure management, applications of inorganic nitrogen fertilisers 
  and animal manure applied to soil, as well as urine and dung deposited by grazing animals.

  Ammonia ($NH_3$) is a colorless, pungent-smelling, corrosive gas produced by the decomposition 
  of plant organic matter and human and animal excrement. When released into the atmosphere, 
  ammonia contributes to air pollution. The agricultural sector remains the largest contributor 
  to ammonia emissions in the EU.

  Measures implemented within the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Water 
  Framework Directive have led the EU to reduce ammonia emissions from agriculture since the 1990s. 
  Specifically, measures to change agricultural practices led to reductions in the use of nitrogen 
  fertilizers and a decrease in livestock density per hectare across the EU-15.

  The National Emission Reduction Commitments Directive (NEC Directive) sets national emission 
  reduction commitments for Member States and the EU for five major air pollutants, including ammonia.
