  The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted by UN Member States in 
  March 2015 as a global policy of disaster risk reduction. 

  The expected outcome of the Sendai Framework is to realize “The substantial reduction of 
  disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health and in the economic, physical, 
  social, cultural and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities and countries”. 
  Among the Sendai Framework global targets, “Target E: Substantially increase the number of 
  countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020” aims to enhance 
  the global progress and coverage of national and local disaster risk reduction strategies and 
  policies. 

  The objectives of the national DRR plans, strategies and policies are to prevent new and 
  reduce existing disaster risk through the implementation of integrated and inclusive economic, 
  structural, legal, social, health, cultural, educational, environmental, technological, 
  political and institutional measures that prevent and reduce hazard exposure and vulnerability 
  to disaster, increase preparedness for response and recovery, and thus strengthen resilience. 

  The indicator will build bridge between the SDGs and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 
  (DRR). Increasing number of national governments that adopt and implement national and local DRR 
  strategies, which the Sendai Framework calls for, will contribute to sustainable development from 
  economic, environmental and social perspectives.
