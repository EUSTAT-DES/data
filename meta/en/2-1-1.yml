descripcion_global: |
  The prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) is an estimate of the
  proportion of the population whose habitual food consumption is insufficient 
  to provide the dietary energy levels that are required to maintain a normal 
  active and healthy life. It is expressed as a percentage.

justificacion_global: |
  
  The indicator has been used by FAO to monitor the World Food Summit Target 
  and the MDG Target 1C, at national, regional and global level, since 1999.

  It allows monitoring trends in the extent of dietary energy inadequacy 
  in a population over time, generated as a result of the combination of changes 
  in the overall availability of food, in the households’ ability to access it, 
  and in the socio-demographic characteristics of the population, as well as 
  differences across countries and regions in any given moment in time.
