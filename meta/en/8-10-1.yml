  Access to and use of formal financial services is essential. Services such as savings, insurance, payments, 
  credit and remittances allow people to manage their lives, plan and pay expenses, grow their 
  businesses and improve their overall welfare. As banks remain one of the key institutions for access to 
  formal financial services, having an accessible bank branch is an important initial point of access to 
  financial services and therefore use of them. 

  Bank branches are complemented by other important points of access such as automated teller machines of 
  all formal financial institutions, which can extend financial services to remote locations.
