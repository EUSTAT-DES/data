  Reporting to competent authorities is the first step for crime victims to seek justice: If competent 
  authorities are not alerted, they are not in a position to conduct proper investigations and administer 
  justice. 

   However, lack of trust and confidence in the ability of the police or other authorities to provide 
  effective redress, or objective and subjective difficulties in accessing the authorities, can negatively 
  influence the reporting behaviour of crime victims. As such, reporting rates provide a direct measure of 
  the confidence of victims of crime in the ability of the police or other authorities to provide assistance 
  and bring perpetrators to justice. 

  Reporting rates also provide a measure of the “hidden figure” of crime, 
  that is, the proportion of crimes not reported to the police. Trends in reporting rates of violent crime can 
  be used to monitor public trust and confidence in competent authorities on the basis of actual 
  behaviours and not perceptions.
