  $$ECAR^{t} = \frac{CAR_{distilled\, spirits}^{t}+CAR_{wine}^{t}+CAR_{beer}^{t}}{P_{15+}^{t}}$$

  where:

  $CAR_{distilled\, spirits}^{t} =$ alcohol consumption recorded in distilled beverages in year $t$

  $CAR_{wine}^{t} =$ alcohol consumption recorded in wine in year $t$

justificacion_global: |

  United Nations indicator measures the harmful use of alcohol, defined according to the national context 
  as alcohol per capita consumption (aged 15 years and older) within a calendar year in litres of pure alcohol.

  Alcohol consumption can have an impact not only on the incidence of diseases, injuries and other health 
  conditions, but also on the course of disorders and their outcomes in individuals. 

  Alcohol consumption has been identified as a component cause for more than 200 diseases, injuries and other health 
  conditions. Per capita alcohol consumption is widely accepted as the best possible indicator of alcohol 
  exposure in populations and the key indicator for estimation of alcohol-attributable disease burden and 
  alcohol-attributable deaths. 

  Its correct interpretation requires the use of additional population-based indicators such as prevalence 
  of drinking, and, as a result, stimulates development of national monitoring systems on alcohol and health 
  involving contributions from a wide range of stakeholders, including alcohol production and trade sectors.
