justificacion_global: | 

  The purpose of SDG indicator 8.b.1 is to provide an indication of the progress of countries in addressing 
  youth employment issues. 

  In this respect, it is assumed that having officially adopted what can be recognised as a structured 
  strategy for youth employment would mean larger attention given by a country to youth labour market 
  challenges, compared to countries with no strategy. 

  In fact, the development of such a strategy usually entails broad participation of and consultation/
  coordination among different stakeholders.
