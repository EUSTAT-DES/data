definicion: |
  
  Proportion of public administration spending in the Basque Country dedicated 
  to essential services: education, health, and social protection (functional groups 09, 
  07, and 10 of the Classification of Government Functions (COFOG), used internationally to 
  classify the purposes of government activities)

formula: |

  $$PE_{t} = \frac{TE_{t} + TH_{t} + TS_{t}}{TG_{t}} \cdot 100$$

  donde:

  $PE_{t}$ = Government expenditure on essential services (education, health, and social protection) as a percentage of total government expenditure in the fiscal year $t$

  $TE_{t}$ = total government expenditure on education in the fiscal year $t$

  $TH_{t}$ = total government expenditure on health in the fiscal year $t$

  $TS_{t}$ = total government expenditure on social protection in the fiscal year $t$

  $TG_{t}$ = total government expenditure in the fiscal year $t$

desagregacion: |
  Essential services: education, health, social protection  

observaciones: |

  The indicator is calculated for the general government, which includes 
  different governmental units: central government, regional government, regional governments, 
  and local governments.

  The Classification of Functions of Government (COFOG), developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and published by the United Nations Statistics Division, structures public expenditure into 10 functional groups:

   - 01 General public services
   - 02 Defence
   - 03 Public order and safety
   - 04 Economic affairs
   - 05 Environmental protection
   - 06 Housing and community services
   - 07 Health
   - 08 Leisure, culture and religion
   - 09 Education
   - 10 Social Protection

justificacion_global: |
  The indicator is used to assess government's expenditure on essential services 
  (education, health and social protection) relative to the amount of total government 
  spending. Since it comes from an international framework, the GFSM 2014, it provides 
  analysts with a cross-country comparable dataset and ensures establishing robust 
  analytical findings to support SDG monitoring using fiscal data.

  A high proportion of government expenditure on essential services (education, health and social
  protection) demonstrates a high government priority for these functions of spending.

  For reporting this indicator, general government is considered the most appropriate 
  level of institutional coverage as it will encompass relevant government units, 
  including local governments, since in many countries descentralization of these 
  categories of expense are to be considered. A country may have one central 
  government; several state, provincial, or regional governments; and many local 
  governments, and the GFSM 2014 recommends that statistics should be compiled for all 
  such general government units.

comparabilidad: >-
  The indicator available in the Basque Country uses the COFOG classification, which does not 
  comply with the metadata of the United Nations indicator but provides similar information. 
  The global indicator uses the Manual of Government Finance Statistics (GFSM), where the concept 
  of expenditure is applied slightly differently.
