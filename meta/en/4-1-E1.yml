  The indicator is used to monitor progress towards SDG 4 on quality education and SDG 5 on gender equality, 
  which are embedded in the European Commission’s Priorities under "Supporting people, strengthening our 
  societies and our social model" and "A new plan for Europe's sustainable prosperity and competitiveness". 

  The Council of the European Union on 26 February 2021 adopted the Resolution on a strategic framework for 
  European cooperation in education and training towards the European Education Area and beyond (2021–2030), 
  a framework that addresses five strategic priorities: (1) Improving quality, equity, inclusion and success 
  for all in education and training; (2) Making lifelong learning and mobility a reality for all; (3) Enhancing 
  competences and motivation in the education profession; (4) Reinforcing European higher education; and 
  (5) Supporting green and digital transitions in and through education and training. 

  The Council Resolution sets the EU-level target for the share of early leavers from education and training 
  as measured by this SDG indicator to be less than 9% by 2030. Furthermore, the indicator is included as 
  main indicator in the Social Scoreboard for the European Pillar of Social Rights. 

  Education and training are key drivers for growth and jobs as they help to improve employability, productivity, 
  innovation and competitiveness. Continuing education after the basic level is important because people with 
  higher qualifications are more likely to be employed and less likely to face poverty in a knowledge-based 
  economy. People with a low level of education may not only face greater difficulties in the labour market but 
  also have a higher risk of poverty and social exclusion.
