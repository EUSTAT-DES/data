justificacion_global: |
  Perception of safety is considered a subjective wellbeing indicator. It affects the way in which human 
  beings interact with their surroundings, their health, and consequently, their quality of life. 

  Indicator 16.1.4 taps into the concept of ‘fear of crime’, which has been elicited in dozens of crime victimization 
  surveys, and the standard formulation used here has been shown to be applicable in different cultural 
  contexts. 

  It is important to note that fear of crime is a phenomenon that is separate from the prevalence 
  of crime and that fear of crime may be even largely independent from actual experience. The perception 
  of crime and the resulting fear of it is influenced by several factors, such as the awareness of crime, the 
  public discussion, the media discourse, and personal circumstances. 

  Nevertheless, fear of crime is an important indicator in itself as high levels of fear can negatively influence 
  well-being and lead to reduced contacts with the public, reduced trust and engagement in the community, and thus 
  represent an obstacle to development. Fear of crime also differs across demographic groups and this indicator helps to 
  identify vulnerable groups.
