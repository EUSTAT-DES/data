  Land tenure systems are facing increasing pressure as the growing global population 
  demands food security, and urbanization, environmental degradation, and climate change 
  affect land use and productivity.

  Many tenure problems also arise due to poor land governance, disputes over land 
  acquisition or large-scale land investments, and attempts to address tenure problems 
  associated with dualisms in land tenure regimes.

  Responsible governance of land tenure is inextricably linked with the access to 
  and management of other natural resources, such as forests, water, fisheries, and 
  mineral resources. Tenure governance is a crucial element in determining whether and 
  how individuals, communities, and others acquire rights, and their associated 
  obligations, to use and control land and natural resources.
 
  The legal recognition of group tenure or the adoption of "fit-for-purpose" land 
  administration and its use to recognize the outer boundaries of land held under 
  communal or customary arrangements have received increasing attention from governments 
  in the recent past.
