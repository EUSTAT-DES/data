  Data for this indicator have been collected by the World Bank 
  through the Remittance Prices Worldwide (RPW) database since 2008 
  for the purpose of monitoring the G8/G20 target on reducing remittance 
  prices. Also known as the “5x5 Objective”, this goal was adopted by 
  the G8 in 2009, and it refers to the reduction of the global average 
  total cost of migrant remittances by 5 percentage points in 5 years. 

  To achieve this objective, the governments in both sending and receiving 
  countries should consider implementing reforms based upon the General 
  Principles for International Remittances Services by the World Bank/Committee 
  on Payment and Settlement Systems (January 2007). This internationally agreed 
  framework has proven effective in helping reduce the cost of remittances and 
  guiding actions to enhance the efficiency of international remittances. 

  The World Bank’s RPW database is the only global database that monitors 
  remittance prices across all regions of the world. RPW was launched by the 
  World Bank in September 2008, and is a key tool in monitoring the evolution 
  of costs to the remitters and the beneficiaries from sending and receiving 
  money in major country corridors.
