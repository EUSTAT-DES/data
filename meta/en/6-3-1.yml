  The indicator is made up of 2 series:

    - Proportion of safely treated domestic wastewater flows: Proportion of the pollution 
   load corresponding to urban agglomerations with more than 2,000 population equivalents 
   that treat their wastewater, reducing their pollution level to an acceptable limit for 
   the receiving waters

    - Proportion of domestic wastewater flows connected to a collection system: Proportion 
   of the pollution load corresponding to urban agglomerations with more than 2,000 population 
   equivalents connected to a conduit system that collects and conveys their wastewater to a 
   treatment facility or final discharge point



formula: |

  <b>Proportion of safely treated domestic wastewater flows</b>

    $$PCC_{\text{purification}}^{t} =
    \left( \frac{CC_{\text{purification}}^{t}}{CC^{t}} \cdot 100 \right)$$

  where:

  $CC_{\text{purification}}^{t} =$ pollution load corresponding to urban agglomerations 
  with more than 2,000 population equivalents that adequately treat their wastewater in year $t$

  $CC^{t} =$ pollution load corresponding to urban agglomerations with more than 2,000 
   population equivalents in year $t$

  <b>Proportion of domestic wastewater flows connected to a collection system</b>

    $$PCC_{\text{collectors}}^{t} =
    \left( \frac{CC_{\text{collectors}}^{t}}{CC^{t}} \cdot 100 \right)$$

  where:

  $CC_{\text{collectors}}^{t} =$ pollution load corresponding to urban agglomerations 
  with more than 2,000 population equivalents connected to a conduit system that collects 
  and conveys their wastewater to a treatment facility or final discharge point $t$ 

  $CC^{t} =$ pollution load corresponding to urban agglomerations with more than 2,000 
  population equivalents in year $t$


desagregacion:

observaciones: |
  
  The pollution load of an urban agglomeration is measured in equivalent inhabitants, 
  with an equivalent inhabitant defined as the biodegradable organic load with a five-day 
  biochemical oxygen demand of 60 grams of oxygen per day. An equivalent inhabitant 
  represents the biodegradable organic load generated by one person in one day in a typical home. 

  It should be noted that the pollution load of an urban agglomeration not only includes 
  pollution due to human excrement, but also pollution from premises used for commercial  
  or industrial activities, provided that it is biodegradable organic. Therefore, the number 
  of equivalent inhabitants of an urban agglomeration is always greater than its actual number 
  of inhabitants.

  This indicator only takes into account urban agglomerations with more than 2,000 population 
  equivalents, in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of Directive 91/271/EEC on urban wastewater 
  treatment.

 # Metadatos mundiales (Descripción del indicador)  

justificacion_global: | 

  Wastewater data are crucial to promote strategies for sustainable and safe wastewater 
  use or reuse to the benefit of the world’s population health and the global environment, 
  but also to respond to growing water demands, increasing water pollution loads, and climate 
  change impacts on water resources. 

  Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) is about ensuring the availability and sustainability 
  of water and sanitation for all by 2030. SDG Target 6.3 sets out to improve ambient water 
  quality, which is essential to protecting both ecosystem and human health, by eliminating, 
  minimizing and significantly reducing different streams of pollution into water bodies. 

  The purpose of monitoring progress using SDG indicator 6.3.1 is to provide necessary and timely 
  information to decision makers and stakeholders to make informed decisions to accelerate progress 
  towards reducing water pollution, minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and increasing wastewater 
  treatment and reuse. 

  The target wording covers wastewater recycling and safe reuse with implication on water use efficiency, 
  although it is not fully addressed by the global indicator and methodology. SDG indicator 6.3.1 tracks 
  the proportion of wastewater flows from households, services and industrial economic activities that 
  are safely treated at the source or through centralized wastewater treatment plants before being discharged 
  into the environment, out of the total volume of wastewater generated.
