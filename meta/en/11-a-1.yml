definicion: |
  This indicator is composed of two time series:

  - Proportion of the population residing in municipalities that have a land use plan
  - Proportion of the population residing in municipalities that have a general plan 
    or subsidiary urban planning regulations

formula: |

  <b>Proportion of the population residing in municipalities that have a land use plan</b>
  
  $$PPTP^{t} = \frac{PTP^{t}}{P^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $PTP^{t} =$ population residing in municipalities that have a Partial Territorial Plan on January 1 of year $t$

  $P^{t} =$ population as of January 1 of year $t$


  <br>

  <b>Proportion of the population residing in municipalities that have a general plan or subsidiary urban planning regulations</b>

  $$PPPGNS^{t} = \frac{PPG^{t}+PNS^{t}}{P^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $PPG^{t} =$ population residing in municipalities that have a general plan on January 1 of year $t$

  $PNS^{t} =$ population residing in municipalities that have subsidiary regulations on January 1 of year $t$

  $P^{t} =$ population as of January 1 of year $t$

justificacion_global: |
  This indicator is based on the notion that the development and implementation 
  of National Urban Policies should support participation, partnership, cooperation 
  and coordination of actors as well as facilitate dialogue. National Urban Policy 
  (NUP) and Regional Development Plans (RDP) promote coordinated and connected urban 
  development. A coordinated effort from government through a NUP or RDP provides the 
  best opportunity for achieving sustainable urbanization and balanced territorial 
  development by linking sectorial policies, connecting national, regional and local 
  government policies, strengthening urban, peri-urban and rural links through balanced 
  territorial development. 

  This indicator provides a good barometer on global progress on sustainable national 
  urban policies. It serves as gap analysis to support policy recommendations. The 
  indicator can identify good practices and policies among countries that can promote 
  partnership and cooperation between all stakeholders. This indicator is both process 
  oriented and aspirational and has the potential to support the validation of Goal 11 
  and other SDGs indicators with an urban component. The indicator has the ability to 
  be applicable at multi jurisdictions levels, i.e covering a number of areas while taking 
  care of urban challenges in a more integrated national manner.
