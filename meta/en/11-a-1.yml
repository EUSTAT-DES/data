definicion: |
  This indicator is composed of two series:

   <b>- Proportion of municipalities covered by a territorial land use plan (PTP)</b>

   <b>- Proportion of municipalities with a municipal urban plan (PGOU or NNSS)</b>


formula: |

  <b>Proportion of municipalities covered by a territorial land use plan (PTP)</b>
  
  $$PMUN_{PTP}^{t} = \frac{MUN_{PTP}^{t}}{MUN^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $MUN_{PTP}^{t} =$ number of municipalities with A territorial land use plan in the year $t$

  $MUN^{t} =$ number of municipalities in the year $t$


  <br>

  <b>Proportion of municipalities with a municipal urban plan (PGOU or NNSS)</b>

  $$PMUN_{PGOU}^{t} = \frac{MUN_{PGOU}^{t}}{MUN^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $MUN_{PGOU}^{t} =$ number of municipalities with municipal urban plan in the year $t$

  $MUN^{t} =$ number of municipalities in the year $t$

justificacion_global: |
  This indicator is based on the notion that the development and implementation 
  of National Urban Policies should support participation, partnership, cooperation 
  and coordination of actors as well as facilitate dialogue. National Urban Policy 
  (NUP) and Regional Development Plans (RDP) promote coordinated and connected urban 
  development. A coordinated effort from government through a NUP or RDP provides the 
  best opportunity for achieving sustainable urbanization and balanced territorial 
  development by linking sectorial policies, connecting national, regional and local 
  government policies, strengthening urban, peri-urban and rural links through balanced 
  territorial development. 

  This indicator provides a good barometer on global progress on sustainable national 
  urban policies. It serves as gap analysis to support policy recommendations. The 
  indicator can identify good practices and policies among countries that can promote 
  partnership and cooperation between all stakeholders. This indicator is both process 
  oriented and aspirational and has the potential to support the validation of Goal 11 
  and other SDGs indicators with an urban component. The indicator has the ability to 
  be applicable at multi jurisdictions levels, i.e covering a number of areas while taking 
  care of urban challenges in a more integrated national manner.
