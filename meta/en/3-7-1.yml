  Proportion of women aged 18–49 years married to a man or with a male partner, who use 
  modern methods of contraception with respect to those who do not wish to become pregnant, 
  i.e. who use methods of contraception or who have an unmet need for family planning

formula: |

  $$PM_{18-49,modern\, contraception}^{t} = \frac{M_{18-49,modern\, contraception}^{t}}{M_{18-49,contraception}^{t}+M_{18-49,unmet}^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $M_{18-49,modern\, contraception}^{t} =$ women aged 18–49 years married to a man or with a male partner, who use modern methods of contraception in year $t$

  $M_{18-49,contraception}^{t} =$ women aged 18–49 years married to a man or with a male partner, who use methods of contraception in year $t$

  $M_{18-49,unmet}^{t} =$ women aged 18–49 years married to a man or with a male partner, who have an unmet need for family planning in year $t$

 # Metadatos mundiales (Descripción del indicador)  

justificacion_global: |

  The indicator measures the percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) currently 
  using a modern method of contraception among those who desire either to have no (additional) 
  children or to postpone the next pregnancy. The indicator is also referred to as the demand 
  for family planning satisfied with modern methods.

  The proportion of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods is useful in 
  assessing overall levels of coverage for family planning programmes and services. Access 
  to and use of an effective means to prevent pregnancy helps enable women and their partners 
  to exercise their rights to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their 
  children and to have the information, education and means to do so. Meeting demand for family 
  planning with modern methods also contributes to maternal and child health by preventing 
  unintended pregnancies and closely spaced pregnancies, which are at higher risk for poor 
  obstetrical outcomes.

  Levels of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods of 75 percent or more are 
  generally considered high, and values of 50 percent or less are generally considered as very low. 
  The indicator has no global numerical ‘target’ value set to be achieved by 2030. Looking at the 
  highest values of the indicator, in 22 countries representing regions such as Europe and Northern 
  America, Latin America and the Caribbean and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, more than 85 percent 
  of women who want to avoid pregnancy are using a modern contraceptive method but for no country 
  is this estimate above 91 percent.

comparabilidad: >- 
  The available indicator does not strictly comply with the metadata of the UN indicator because it uses a different age group, but provides similar information.
