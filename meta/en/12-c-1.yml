  The scale and impact of fossil fuel subsidies presents both challenges 
  and opportunities for achieving the goals of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable 
  Development. For one, the use of fossil fuels, and their promotion through 
  subsidy schemes, adversely affects the ability of governments to attain key 
  goals, such as reducing poverty, improving health, reaching gender equality, 
  providing access to energy, and addressing climate change. 

  At the same time, there is a need to ensure that poor households that are 
  particularly vulnerable to price increases obtain or retain access to energy. 
  Energy-dependent sectors of the economy can be affected, particularly by abrupt 
  changes in prices. Any successful reform therefore requires careful analysis 
  and adapted mitigation measures. For another, reallocating fossil fuel subsidies 
  to sectors that are relevant for development could give a boost to reaching the 
  SDGs.
