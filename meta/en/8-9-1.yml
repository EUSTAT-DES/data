  GDP generated by tourism as a proportion of total GDP at current prices, and annual 
  growth rate of GDP generated by tourism.

formula:  |

  <b>GDP generated by tourism as a proportion of total GDP</b>

  $$PPIB_{tourism}^{t} = \frac{PIB_{tourism}^{t}}{PIB^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $PIB_{tourism}^{t} =$ gross domestic product generated by tourism at current prices in year $t$

  $PIB^{t} =$ gross domestic product at current prices in year $t$

  <br>

  <b>Annual growth rate of GDP generated by tourism</b>

  $$TCPIB^{t}_{tourism} = \left( \frac{PIB^{t}_{tourism} - PIB^{t-1}_{tourism}}{PIB^{t-1}_{tourism}} \right) \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $PIB^{t-1}_{tourism} =$ gross domestic product at current prices in year $t-1$

justificacion_global: | 

  Target 8.9 has several dimensions and indicator 8.9.1 caters to the core intention of the target which calls 
  to “promote sustainable tourism”. While sustainable tourism is multidimensional in itself (with economic, 
  social and environmental aspects), the economic contribution of tourism captured by this indicator, and 
  (relative) increases or decreases in it, indicates the degree to which tourism is being successfully 
  promoted. 

  Ideally, this indicator needs to be complemented with additional indicators on the social (e.g. 
  employment, etc.) and environmental (energy use, GHG emissions, etc.) aspects of tourism that can be 
  disaggregated to provide a more complete picture of the promotion of sustainable tourism and thus the 
  monitoring of this target. 

  This indicator is useful for policy on tourism at international, national level and the level of sub-national 
  regions as it provides a measure of the economic contribution of tourism which can be compared over 
  time, across countries, to total GDP and to the GDP contributions of other economic activities. 

  Tourism Direct GDP includes the contributions from all forms of tourism—inbound tourism, domestic tourism and 
  outbound tourism—in line with the International Recommendations for Tourism Statistics 2008 (IRTS 
  2008). The indicator has been found especially useful in raising awareness of the economic importance of 
  tourism and making the case for a more proactive, sustainable management of a sector that is often 
  overlooked in policy agendas at all levels.
