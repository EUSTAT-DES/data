justificacion_global: | 

  Financial inclusion means that households have access to and can effectively use appropriate financial 
  services that are provided responsibly and sustainably in a well-regulated environment. Studies show that 
  when people participate in the financial system, they are better able to start and expand businesses, 
  invest in education, manage risk and absorb financial shocks.  

  Measurement is key to understanding financial inclusion and identifying opportunities to remove barriers 
  that may be preventing people from using financial services.
