  Percentage of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk 
  reduction strategies through territorial emergency plans and municipal emergency plans
  

formula: |
  <b>Percentage of municipalities that have a municipal emergency plan</b>

  $$PMUN_{DRR\, municipal}^{t} = \frac{MUN_{DRR\, municipal}^{t}}{MUN^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $MUN_{DRR\, municipal}^{t} =$ number of local governments with municipal emergency plans in the year $t$

  $MUN^{t} =$ number of local governments in the year $t$

  <b>Percentage of municipalities covered by a territorial emergency plan</b>

  $$PMUN_{DRR\, territorial}^{t} = \frac{MUN_{DRR\, territorial}^{t}}{MUN^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $MUN_{DDR\, territorial}^{t} =$ number of local governments with territorial emergency plans in the year $t$

  $MUN^{t} =$ number of local governments in the year $t$

observaciones: |

  In the Basque Country, according to the Basque Civil Protection Plan (LABI), municipalities 
  with a population of over 20,000 must prepare and approve municipal emergency plans (PEM). 

  For municipalities with more than 5,000 inhabitants, in accordance with the state regulations 
  governing the Bases of the Local Government, this guideline is recommendatory. In 2024, 96% of 
  municipalities with 5,000 to 20,000 inhabitants and 25% of municipalities with 1,000 to 5,000 
  inhabitants have an approved Municipal Emergency Plan.

justificacion_global: |
  The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted by UN Member States in 
  March 2015 as a global policy of disaster risk reduction. The expected outcome of the Sendai Framework 
  is to realize “The substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods 
  and health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets of persons, 
  businesses, communities and countries”.

  Among the Sendai Framework global targets, “Target E: Substantially increase the number of 
  countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies by 2020” aims to enhance 
  the global progress and coverage of national and local disaster risk reduction strategies and policies.

  The objectives of the national DRR plans, strategies and policies are to prevent new and reduce 
  existing disaster risk through the implementation of integrated and inclusive economic, structural, 
  legal, social, health, cultural, educational, environmental, technological, political and institutional 
  measures that prevent and reduce hazard exposure and vulnerability to disaster, increase preparedness 
  for response and recovery, and thus strengthen resilience.

  Increasing the proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction 
  strategies, which the Sendai Framework calls for, will contribute to sustainable development and 
  strengthen economic, social, health and environmental resilience.
