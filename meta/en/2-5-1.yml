  Genetic resources for food and agriculture provide the building blocks of food 
  security and, directly or indirectly, support the livelihoods of every person on earth.

  As the conservation and accessibility to these resources are of vital importance, 
  medium- or long- term conservation facilities (genebanks) to preserve and make these 
  resources and their associated information accessible for breeding and research have 
  been established at country, regional and global levels. Inventories of genebank holdings 
  provide a dynamic measure of the existing plant and animal diversity and its level of preservation. 
  Data relevant to this indicator facilitate the monitoring of diversity secured and accessible 
  through genebanks and support the development and updating of strategies for the conservation 
  and sustainable use of genetic resources.

  The indicator is related to a monitoring framework endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic 
  Resources for Food and Agriculture in which the status and trends of plant and animal 
  genetic resources are described through globally agreed indicators and regular 
  country-driven assessments.

  The number of materials conserved under medium- or long-term storage conditions provides 
  an indirect measurement of the total genetic diversity, which are managed to secure for future 
  use. Overall, positive variations are therefore approximated to an increase in the agro-biodiversity 
  secured, while negative variations to a loss of it.
