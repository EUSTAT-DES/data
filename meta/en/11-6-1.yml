  Urban waste collected per capita and proportion of urban waste treated 
  in relation to total urban waste generated, and 
  the proportion of urban waste collected and managed in controlled facilities.

  Urban or municipal waste is waste generated in private homes, businesses, offices, 
  and services, as well as any waste that, due 
  to its nature or composition, can be assimilated to that produced in the aforementioned places or activities.

  The following are also considered urban waste:

   - Waste from cleaning public streets, green areas, recreational areas, and beaches

   - Dead domestic animals, as well as abandoned furniture, fixtures, and vehicles

   - Waste and debris from minor construction and home repairs

formula: |

  <b> Urban waste collected per capita</b> 

  $$RURP^{t} = \frac{RUR^{t}}{P^{t}} $$

  where:

  $RUR^{t} =$ amount of urban waste collected in year $t$ 

  $P^{t} =$ population as of 1 July of year $t$

  <br>

  <b> Proportion of urban waste collected and managed in controlled facilities</b>

  $$PRUR^{t} = \frac{RUG^{t}}{RUR^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $RUG^{t} =$ amount of urban waste generated in year $t$ 

  $RUR^{t} =$ amount of urban waste collected and managed in controlled facilities in year $t$ 


  <br>

  <b> Proportion of urban waste treated, per treatment operation</b> 

  $$PRU_{treatment}^{t} = \frac{RU_{treatment}^{t}}{RU^{t}} \cdot 100$$ <br> 

  $RU_{treatment}^{t} =$ amount of urban waste treated (by type of treatment) in year $t$

  $RUR^{t} =$ amount of urban waste collected and managed in controlled facilities in year $t$

justificacion_global: |
  Urban households and businesses produce substantial amounts of solid waste that 
  must be collected regularly, recycled or treated and disposed properly in order 
  to maintain healthy and sanitary living conditions. 

  Many cities are increasingly facing solid waste management challenges due to rapid 
  urbanization, lack of technical and financial capacity or low policy priority. In 
  addition, the higher the income level of a city, the greater the amount of the solid 
  waste produced. 

  Therefore, the economic growth to be experienced in the developing and emerging 
  countries will pose greater challenges in solid waste management to local governments 
  in the next decades.
