justificacion_global: |

  The United Nations indicator is based on nine components. The proportion of 
  the population living in households with access to basic services is defined 
  as the proportion of the population using public service delivery systems that meet 
  basic human needs, including safe drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, energy, 
  mobility, waste collection, healthcare, education, and information technology.

  These components are captured in various standalone indicators of the SDGs, 
  which means that the concepts and definitions of SDG indicator 1.4.1 will 
  be derived from or are the same as those of these specific SDG indicators.

  Among the different aspects of poverty, this indicator focuses on access to basic services. 
  Providing access to basic services such as safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene 
  services, sustainable energy and mobility, housing, education, healthcare, etc., helps improve 
  the quality of life of the poor.

  The lack of basic service provision and the lack of empowerment and participation 
  of local governments in the provision of basic services undermine economic growth 
  and the quality of life in any community. Adequate basic service delivery systems 
  promote socioeconomic improvements and help achieve economic growth, social inclusion, 
  poverty reduction, and equality.

  More specifically, improved basic services can help to raise well-being and productivity 
  of communities, create jobs, save time and human effort in transporting water, 
  support food security, better use of energy, production of essential commodities, 
  improve health (by making medical care, clean water or solid waste collection available) 
  or enhance the level of education.
