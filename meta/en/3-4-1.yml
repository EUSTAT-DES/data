definicion: |

  This indicator is composed of two time series:

   <b>-Premature mortality rate (between ages 30 and 70) attributed to non-communicable diseases: 
   probability of dying between ages 30 and 70 from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or 
   chronic respiratory disease.

   <b>-Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory 
   disease per 100,000 inhabitants </b>: Deaths attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes 
   or chronic respiratory disease per 100,000 inhabitants.

formula: |

  <b>Premature mortality rate attributed to non-communicable diseases</b>

  $$^{5}M_x = \frac{DENT_{x,x+5}^{t}}{PENT_{x,x+5}^{t}}$$

  where:

  $DENT_{x,x+5}^{t} =$ Deaths attributed to the 4 non-communicable diseases
  between exact age $x$ and exact age $x+5$ in year $t$

  $P^{t} =$ population between exact age $x$ and exact age $x+5$ in year $t$


  <b>Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory 
   disease per 100,000 inhabitants</b>


  $$TM_{ENT}^{t} = \frac{D_{ENT}^{t}}{P^{t}} \cdot 100.000$$


  where:

  $D_{ENT}^{t} =$ Deaths attributed to non-communicable diseases in year $t$

  $P^{t} =$ population as of 1 July of year $t$

  The following International Classification of Diseases codes are used for each of the non-communicable diseases:
  - cardiovascular diseases (ICD-10 codes I00-I99) 
  - cancer (ICD-10 codes C00-C97)
  - diabetes (ICD-10 codes E10-E14)
  - chronic respiratory disease (ICD-10 codes J30-J98)

justificacion_global: |

  Morbidity from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) among adults is increasing rapidly globally due to aging 
  and epidemiological transitions. Cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory 
  diseases are the four leading causes of the NCD burden. Measuring the risk of dying from these four 
  leading causes is important for assessing the extent of the premature NCD mortality burden in a population, 
  assuming they would experience current mortality rates at any age and would not die from any other cause 
  of death (e.g., injuries or HIV/AIDS).

  The mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease 
  is the probability of dying between ages 30 and 70 from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or 
  chronic respiratory disease, defined as the percentage of 30-year-olds who would die before reaching age 70
  from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease, assuming they would 
  experience current mortality rates at any age and would not die from any other cause of death (e.g., 
  injuries or HIV/AIDS).
