  Rational environmental management means making the best use of resources to meet basic human needs 
  without destroying the sustaining and regenerative capacity of natural systems. This requires a good 
  understanding of the intersecting elements within the larger frame of development and implies the 
  adoption and use of alternative, environmentally sound development strategies and related technologies.  

  ESTs play an important role to improve efficiency of resources (materials and energy), and reduce pollution 
  and waste from different sectors. The importance of Environmentally Sound Technology was first 
  emphasized during Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and ever since it has become a major component of 
  international environmental cooperation. 

  Access to ESTs also plays a central role in the ground-breaking 
  agreement, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda – which is an implementing mechanism for the global 
  Sustainable Development Goals (2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development). The agreement was reached 
  by the 193 UN Member States.
