  $HD^{t} =$ number of known criminal offenses for intentional homicide/completed murder in year $t$

  $P^{t} =$ population as of July 1 of year $t$

justificacion_global: |
  This indicator is widely used at national and international level to measure the most extreme 
  form of violent crime and it also provides a direct indication of lack of security. 

  Security from violence is a prerequisite for individuals to enjoy a safe and active life and 
  for societies and economies to develop freely. Intentional homicides occur in all countries 
  of the world and this indicator has a global applicability. Monitoring intentional homicides 
  is necessary to better assess their causes, drivers and consequences and, in the longer term, 
  to develop effective preventive measures. If data are properly disaggregated (as suggested in 
  the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes), the indicator can identify 
  the different type of violence associated with homicide: inter-personal (including partner and 
  familyrelated violence), crime (including organized crime and other forms of criminal activities) 
  and sociopolitical (including terrorism, hate crime). 

  Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent 
  to cause death or serious injury (International Classification of Crime for Statistical 
  Purposes, ICCS 2015).
