  The indicator “measures” the level to which a country’s legal framework supports women’s land rights, by 
  testing that framework against six proxies drawn from international law and internationally accepted good 
  practices, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) 
  and the Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of the Tenure of Land Fisheries and Forestry (VGGT):  
  - Proxy A: Joint registration of land is compulsory or encouraged through economic incentives 
  - Proxy B: Compulsory spousal consent for land transactions 
  - Proxy C: Women’s and girls’ equal inheritance rights 
  - Proxy D: Allocation of financial resources to increase women’s ownership and control over land 
  - Proxy E: In legal systems that recognize customary land tenure, the existence of explicit protection of the 
  land rights of women
  - Proxy F: Mandatory quotas for women’s participation in land management and administration institutions

  Indicator 5.a.2 measures the extent to which countries’ legal framework (including customary law) 
  guarantees women’s equal rights to land ownership and/or control. 

  The focus on land of Indicator 5.a.2 reflects the recognition that land is a key economic resource 
  inextricably linked to access to, use of and control over other economic and productive resources. 
  It is a key input for agricultural production; it can facilitate access to financial and extension 
  services or to join producer organisations. Moreover, it can generate income directly if rented or sold. 

  It also acknowledges that women’s ownership of and/or control of land is critical for poverty reduction, 
  food security, inclusiveness and overall sustainable development objectives. Finally, gender equality 
  in land ownership and control is a human right. For example, the International Covenant on Civil and 
  Political Rights (ICCPR) guarantees equality between women and men, and prohibits discrimination based 
  on sex in Article 2. 

  Article 26 of the ICCPR enshrines equality before the law and can be applied to defend women’s right to 
  non-discrimination and equality, including economic and social rights. Further, the Convention on the 
  Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), emphasizes that discrimination against women 
  “violates the principles of equality of rights and respect for human dignity".
