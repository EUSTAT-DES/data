  While there is no standard definition of access to justice, it is broadly concerned with “the ability of 
  people to defend and enforce their rights and obtain just resolution of justiciable problems in compliance 
  with human rights standards; if necessary, through impartial formal or informal institutions of 
  justice and with appropriate legal support.”  

  For citizens in need of justice, a number of conditions should 
  be met for their rights to be recognised, such as access to adequate information, access to justice services 
  and legal advice, and access to institutions of justice that provide fair and impartial treatment. The rationale 
  of this indicator is to focus on one step of the process and in particular on the accessibility of justice institutions 
  and mechanisms (both formal and informal) by those who have experienced a justiciable problem. 

  The indicator can provide important information about the overall accessibility of civil justice institutions 
  and processes, barriers, and reasons for exclusion of some people.
