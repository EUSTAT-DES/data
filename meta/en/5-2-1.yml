justificacion_global: |
  Intimate partner violence is one of the most common forms of violence that 
  women face globally. Given prevailing social norms that sanction male dominance 
  over women, male violence towards their female intimate partners is often perceived 
  as an ordinary/normal element of relationships in the context of marriage or other 
  unions/relationships. 

  Violence against women is an extreme manifestation of gender inequality and 
  discrimination. 

  Prevalence data are required to measure the magnitude of the problem; understand 
  the various forms of violence and their consequences; identify groups at high risk 
  and explore the barriers to seeking help to ensure that the appropriate responses 
  are being provided. These data are the starting point for informing laws, policies 
  and developing effective responses and prevention programs. They also allow countries 
  to monitor change over time and optimally target resources to maximize the effectiveness 
  of interventions (especially in resource-constrained settings).
