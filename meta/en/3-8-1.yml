justificacion_global: |

  The indicator measures coverage of essential health services (defined as the average coverage of essential 
  services based on tracer interventions that include reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, 
  infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases and service capacity and access, among the general and the most 
  disadvantaged population).

  Target 3.8 is defined as “Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to 
  quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential 
  medicines and vaccines for all”. The objective is for all people and communities to receive the quality 
  health services they need (including medicines and other health products), without financial hardship. 

  Two indicators have been chosen to monitor target 3.8 within the SDG framework. Indicator 3.8.1 is for 
  health service coverage and indicator 3.8.2 focuses on health expenditures in relation to a household’s 
  budget to identify financial hardship caused by direct health care payments. Taken together, indicators 
  3.8.1 and 3.8.2 are meant to capture the service coverage and financial protection dimensions, 
  respectively, of target 3.8. These two indicators should be always monitored jointly. 

  Countries provide many essential services for health protection, promotion, prevention, treatment and 
  care. Indicators of service coverage – defined as people receiving the service they need – are the best 
  way to track progress in providing services under universal health coverage (UHC).
