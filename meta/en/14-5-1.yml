definicion:
  Percentage of important sites for marine biodiversity (those that contribute significantly to the 
  global persistence of biodiversity) that are covered by protected areas 

formula: |

  $$PKBA_{mar}^{t} = \frac{APKBA_{mar}^{t}}{KBA_{mar}^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $APKBA_{mar}^{t} =$ area of ​​important sites for marine biodiversity covered by protected areas in year $t$

  $KBA_{mar} =$ surface area of ​​important sites for marine biodiversity in year $t$

justificacion_global: |
  The safeguard of important sites is vital for stemming the decline in biodiversity and ensuring long term 
  and sustainable use of marine natural resources. The establishment of protected areas is an important 
  mechanism for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring progress toward the 
  conservation, restoration and sustainable use of marine ecosystems and their services, in line with 
  obligations under international agreements. 

  This indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from traditionally reported 
  simple statistics of marine area covered by protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected 
  area within a country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100 (e.g., Chape et al. 
  2005). Such percentage area coverage statistics do not recognise the extreme variation of biodiversity 
  importance over space (Rodrigues et al. 2004), and so risk generating perverse outcomes through the 
  protection of areas which are large at the expense of those which require protection.
