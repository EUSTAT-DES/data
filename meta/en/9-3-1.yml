justificacion_global: | 

  Industrial enterprises are classified as small for their distinct nature of economic organization, 
  production capability, scale of investment and other economic characteristics. 

  “Small-scale industries” can be run with a small amount of capital, relatively unskilled labor 
  and using local materials. 

  Despite their relatively small contribution to total industrial output, their role in job creation, 
  especially in developing countries is recognized to be significant where the scope of absorbing 
  surplus labor force from traditional sectors such as agriculture or fishery is very high. “Small-scale 
  industries” are capable of meeting domestic demand of basic consumer goods such as food, clothes, 
  furniture, etc.
