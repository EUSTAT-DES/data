  Renewable energy share in gross final energy consumption

formula: |

  $$PER^{t} = \frac{ER^{t}}{CFE^{t}} \cdot 100$$ 

  where:

  $ER^{t} =$ consumption of energy from renewable sources in the year $t$ 

  $CFE^{t} =$ renewable energy share in gross final energy consumption in year $t$

justificacion_global: | 

  The target “By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable 
  energy in the global energy mix” impacts all three dimensions of 
  sustainable development. 

  Renewable energy technologies represent a major element in strategies 
  for greening economies everywhere in the world and for tackling the critical 
  global problem of climate change. 

  A number of definitions of renewable energy exist; what they have in 
  common is highlighting as renewable all forms of energy that their 
  consumption does not deplete their availability in the future. These 
  include solar, wind, ocean, hydropower, geothermal sources, and bioenergy 
  (in the case of bioenergy, which can be depleted, sources of bioenergy can 
  be replaced withina short to medium-term frame). 

  Importantly, this indicator focuses on the amount of renewable energy actually 
  consumed rather than the capacity for renewable energy production, which cannot 
  always be fully utilized. By focusing on consumption by the end user, it avoids 
  the distortions caused by the fact that conventional energy sources are subject 
  to significant energy losses along the production chain.
