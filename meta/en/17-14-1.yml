justificacion_global: |
  Enhancing policy coherence for sustainable development is important for achieving sustainable 
  development in its three dimensions (economic, social and environmental) in a balanced and integrated 
  manner; for ensuring coherence between policies at various levels of government; and for ensuring that 
  policies in different sectors are mutually supportive and do not work against each other. It is also important 
  in addressing the impacts of domestic policy internationally. 

  Policy coherence aims, as a minimum, to identify trade-offs and mitigate negative impacts between 
  policies. At a more ambitious level, it should also aim to foster synergies and produce policies that mutually 
  reinforce each other and to ensure that policies put in place are implementable and sustainable as they 
  are inclusive of the concerned stakeholders’ perspectives.
