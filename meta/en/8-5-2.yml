justificacion_global: | 

  The unemployment rate is a useful measure of the underutilization of the 
  labour supply. It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment 
  for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are 
  available for employment and actively seeking work. It is thus seen as an 
  indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour 
  force and of the performance of the labour market. 

  Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can be used to signal changes in 
  the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with recessionary 
  periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as persons 
  previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through an active job 
  search.
