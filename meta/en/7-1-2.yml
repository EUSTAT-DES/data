definicion: |

  Number of people using clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating, 
  and lighting, divided by the total population using cooking, heating, or 
  lighting, expressed as a percentage. 

  “Clean” is defined by the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations 
  included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality. Unprocessed 
  coal and kerosene are considered unclean fuels.

formula: |

  $$PPUC_{clean\, fuels}^{t} = \frac{PUC_{clean\, fuels}^{t}}{PUC^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $PUC_{clean\, fuels}^{t} =$ people using clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating, 
  and lighting in year $t$

  $P^{t} =$ population that uses cooking, heating or lighting in year $t$

justificacion_global: | 

  Cooking, lighting and heating represent a large share of household 
  energy use across the low- and middle-income countries. For cooking 
  and heating, households typically rely on solid fuels (such as wood, 
  charcoal, biomass) or kerosene paired with inefficient technologies 
  (e.g. open fires, stoves, space heaters or lamps). 

  It is well known that reliance on such inefficient energy for cooking, 
  heating and lighting is associated with high levels of household (indoor) 
  air pollution. 

  The use of inefficient fuels for cooking alone is estimated to cause over 
  4 million deaths annually, mainly among women and children. This is 
  more than Tuberculosis, Human Immuno-deficiency Virus and malaria combined. 
  These adverse health impacts can be avoided by adopting clean fuels and 
  technologies for all main household energy end-or in some circumstances by 
  adopting advanced combustion cook stoves (i.e. those which achieve the 
  emission rates targets provided by the WHO guidelines) and adopting strict 
  protocols for their safe use.
