  The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance 
  (ODA) is a quantifiable measurement as a proxy for “international cooperation 
  and capacity development support” in financial terms. It is essential to be able 
  to assess ODA in proportion with how much of it is included in the government 
  budget to gain a better understanding of whether donors are aligned with national 
  governments while highlighting total water and sanitation ODA disbursements to 
  developing countries over time. 

  A low value of this indicator (near 0%) would suggest that international donors 
  are investing in water and sanitation related activities and programmes in the 
  country outside the purview of the national government. A high value (near 100%) 
  would indicate that donors are aligned with national government and national policies 
  and plans for water and sanitation.
