justificacion_global: | 

  The share of youth not in employment, education or training (youth NEET rate) provides a measure of 
  youth who are outside the educational system, not in training and not in employment, and thus serves as 
  a broader measure of potential youth labour market entrants than youth unemployment. 

  It includes discouraged worker youth as well as those who are outside the labour force due to disability or 
  engagement in household chores, among other reasons. 

  Youth NEET is also a better measure of the current universe of potential youth labour market entrants 
  as compared with the youth inactivity rate, as the latter includes those youth who are outside the labour 
  force and are in education, and thus are furthering their skills and qualifications.
