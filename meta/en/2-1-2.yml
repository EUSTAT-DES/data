  Percentage of the population experiencing any of the food insecurity problems 
  listed in the Food Security Scale (FSS) during the past twelve months

formula: |

  $$T_{FSS}^{t} = \frac{P_{FSS}^{t}}{P^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $P_{FSS}^{t} =$ Population that has suffered a severe or very severe food insecurity 
  situation in the last 12 months of the year $t$

  $P^{t} =$ total population in the year $t$

desagregacion:

justificacion_global: |

  Food insecurity at moderate levels of severity is typically associated with the inability 
  to regularly eat healthy, balanced diets. As such, high prevalence of food insecurity at 
  moderate levels can be considered a predictor of various forms of diet-related health 
  conditions in the population, associated with micronutrient deficiency and unbalanced diets. 

  Severe levels of food insecurity, on the other hand, imply a high probability of reduced 
  food intake and therefore can lead to more severe forms of undernutrition, including hunger.

  Short questionnaires like the FIES are very easy to administer at limited cost, which is 
  one of the main advantages of their use.
