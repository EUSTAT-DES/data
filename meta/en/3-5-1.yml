  Number of first-time outpatient treatment admissions for addictive substance abuse or dependence 
  at a treatment center in a given year per 100,000 population

formula: |

  $$TAT_{addictive\, substances}^{t} = \frac{AT_{addictive\, substances}^{t}}{P^{t}} \cdot 100.000$$

  where:

  $AT_{addictive\, substances}^{t} =$ Number of admissions to outpatient treatment for addictive substance abuse or 
  dependence at a treatment center for the first time in the year $t$

  $P^{t} =$ population on July 1 of year $t$

  There may be some overestimation of the indicator at the state level, given that the same person may 
  have been notified in two or more different communities and their identification is not possible for 
  confidentiality reasons.

  Treatment: Any intervention performed by qualified professionals to eliminate, reduce, or control drug use.

  Outpatient: the person does not spend the night at the facility. This criterion does not apply to penitentiary centers.

  Illegal drugs: Alcohol and nicotine (tobacco) are not considered illegal drugs.

  This United Nations indicator measures the coverage of treatment interventions for substance 
  use disorders is defined as the number of people who received treatment in a year divided by 
  the total number of people with substance use disorders in the same year. This indicator is 
  disaggregated by two broad groups of psychoactive substances: (1) drugs, (2) alcohol and other 
  psychoactive substances.

  According to United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and World Health Organization (WHO) 
  data, around 296 million people aged 15 to 64 years worldwide used an illicit drug at least once in 
  2021, about 2.3 billion people are current drinkers of alcohol, some 35 million of people suffer 
  from drug use disorders and 289 million from alcohol use disorders.

  Substance use disorders are serious health conditions that present a significant burden for affected 
  individuals, their families and communities. Untreated substance use disorders trigger substantial costs 
  to society including lost productivity, increased health care expenditure, and costs related to criminal 
  justice, social welfare, and other social consequences.
 
  Strengthening treatment services entails providing access to a comprehensive set of evidence-based 
  interventions (-laid down in the international standards and guidelines) that should be available 
  to all population groups in need. The indicator will inform the extent to which a range of evidence-based
  interventions for treatment of substance use disorder are available and are accessed by the population 
  in need at country, regional and global level.

  Even though effective treatment exists, only a small amount of people with substance use disorders 
  receive it. For instance, it is estimated that globally one out of 7 people with drug use disorders 
  have access to or provided drug treatment services (World Drug Report 2019). WHO ATLAS-Substance 
  Use data showed that in 2014 only 11.9 % (out of 103 responding) countries reported high coverage (40% 
  or more) for alcohol dependence. SDG indicator 3.5.1 is crucial for measurement the progress 
  towards strengthening the treatment of substance abuse worldwide as formulated in the Target 3.5.
