  Proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water 
  cooperation

formula: |

  $$PSTCOOP^{t} = \frac{STCOOP^{t}}{ST^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $STCOOP^{t} =$ transboundary basin area covered by an operational arrangement for water in the year $t$ 

  $ST^{t} =$ transboundary basin area in the year $t$

  The majority of the world’s water resources are shared: 468 transboundary aquifers 
  have been identified in 2021 and 310 transboundary lake and river basins cover nearly 
  one half of the Earth’s land surface and account for an estimated 60% of global freshwater. 
  Approximately 40% of the world’s population lives in river and lake basins shared by two 
  or more countries and over 90% lives in countries that share basins. 

  Development of water resources has impacts across transboundary basins, potentially on 
  countries sharing transboundary basins, and use of surface water or groundwater may affect 
  the other resource, which are often interlinked. Intensive water use, flow regulation or 
  pollution risks going as far as compromising the development aspirations of countries 
  sharing transboundary basins and therefore transboundary cooperation is required. However, 
  cooperation is in many cases not advanced.
