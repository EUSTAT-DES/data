  The United Nations define the indicator as the percentage of youth and adults in a given age 
  range (15-24 years, 25-54 years, 55-64 years, 15-64 years) participating in formal or non-formal 
  education and training in the previous 12 months.

  The indicator measures the level of participation of youth and adults in education and training of all types.
