 # Metadatos mundiales (Descripción del indicador)  

justificacion_global: |

  The United Nations indicator is defined as the percentage of the population 
  aged 15 years and over who currently use any tobacco product (smoked and/or 
  smokeless tobacco) on a daily or non-daily basis.

  Tobacco use is a major contributor to illness and death from non-communicable 
  diseases (NCDs). There is no proven safe level of tobacco use or of second-hand 
  smoke exposure. All daily and non-daily users of tobacco are at risk of a variety 
  of poor health outcomes across the life-course, including NCDs.

  Reducing the prevalence of current tobacco use will make a large contribution to 
  reducing premature mortality from NCDs (Target 3.4).

  Routine and regular monitoring of this indicator is necessary to enable accurate 
  monitoring and evaluation of the impact of implementation of the WHO Framework 
  Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), or tobacco control policies in the 
  countries that are not yet Parties to the WHO FCTC, over time.

  Tobacco use prevalence levels are an appropriate indicator of implementation 
  of SDG Target 3.a “Strengthen the implementation of the World Health Organization 
  Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in all countries, as appropriate”.
