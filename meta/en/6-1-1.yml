definicion:  |
  The proportion of the population using safely managed drinking 
  water services is defined as the proportion of population using 
  an improved drinking water source which is accessible on premises, 
  available when needed and free from faecal and priority chemical 
  contamination. 

  "Improved" drinking water sources include: piped supplies, boreholes 
  and tubewells, protected dug wells, protected springs, rainwater, water 
  kiosks, and packaged and delivered water. 

formula:  |

  $$PPC^{t} = \frac{PC^{t}}{P^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $PC^{t} =$ population using safely managed drinking water services in the year $t$

  $P{t} =$ population on July 1 of year $t$

  Access to safe drinking water is essential for good health, welfare 
  and productivity and is widely recognized as a human right. Drinking 
  water may be contaminated with human or animal faeces containing pathogens 
  or with chemical and physical contaminants, leading to harmful effects on 
  health. 

  While improving water quality is critical to prevent the transmission of 
  many diseases (such as diarrhoea which exacerbates malnutrition and remains 
  a leading global cause of child deaths), improving the accessibility and 
  availability of drinking water is equally important for health and welfare, 
  particularly for women and girls who often bear the primary responsibility 
  for collecting drinking water from distant sources. 

  SDG indicator 6.1.1 is designed to address safe management of drinking water 
  services, including dimensions of accessibility, availability and quality.
