definicion: >-
  Proportion of the target population covered by all vaccines included in their national programme

formula: |

  $$PPV_{\text{vaccine}}^{t} = \frac{PV_{\text{vaccine}}^{\text{cohort}\, t - c}}{P^{\text{cohort}\, t - c}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $PV_{\text{vaccine}}^{\text{cohort}\, t - c}=$ population vaccinated with the specified type of vaccine, 
  belonging to the cohort born in $t-c$

  $P^{\text{cohort}\, t - c}=$ total population of the cohort born in $t-c$

  ${c}=$ interval of years that defines the specific cohort for each vaccine (c=1 or cohort born at t-1 for DPTa and VNC, c=5 for SRP and c=13 for VPH)

observaciones: |

  The results are obtained using the definitions proposed by the Vaccination Registry and 
  Program Report and agreed by the Public Health Commission in October 2017. Since then, 
  vaccination coverage has been calculated by population birth cohorts. 
  
  Vaccines purchased in pharmacies or administered by the private health sector are not included.

justificacion_global: | 
  This indicator aims to measure access to vaccines, including the newly available or 
  underutilized vaccines, at the national level.

  In the past decades all countries added numerous new and underutilised vaccines in 
  their national immunization schedule and there are several vaccines under final stage of 
  development to be introduced by 2030. For monitoring diseases control and impact of vaccines 
  it is important to measure coverage from each vaccine in national immunization schedule. 
  Direct measurement for proportion of population covered with all vaccines in the programme 
  is only feasible if the country has a wellfunctioning national electronic immunization registry 
  allowing coverage by cohort to be easily estimated. 

  Following vaccines are measured:

   - Coverage of DTP containing vaccine (3rd dose): Percentage of surviving infants who 
  received the 3 doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoid with pertussis containing vaccine 
  in a given year.

   - Coverage of Measles containing vaccine (2nd dose): Percentage of children who received 
  two dose of measles containing vaccine according to nationally recommended schedule through 
  routine immunization services in a given year. 

   - Coverage of Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (last dose in the schedule): Percentage of 
  surviving infants who received the nationally recommended doses of pneumococcal conjugate 
  vaccine in a given year. 

   - Coverage of HPV vaccine (last dose in the schedule): Percentage of 15 years old girls 
  who received the recommended doses of HPV vaccine. Currently performance of the programme 
  in the previous calendar year based on target age group is used.
