definicion: >-
  Hazardous waste generated per capita and proportion of hazardous waste treated 
  by treatment operation (incinerated, landfilled, and recycled) in relation to 
  total hazardous waste generated and treated.

formula: |

  <b> Hazardous waste generated per capita</b> 

  $$RPPC^{t} = \frac{RP^{t}}{P^{t}} $$

  where:

  $RP^{t} =$ amount of hazardous waste generated in year $t$ 

  $P^{t} =$ population as of July 1 of year $t$

  <br>

  <b> Proportion of hazardous waste treated, by type of treatment</b> 

  $$PRP_{treatment}^{t} = \frac{RP_{treatment}^{t}}{RP^{t}} \cdot 100$$ <br> 

  $RP_{treatment}^{t} =$ amount of hazardous waste treated, by type of treatment in year $t$

  $RP^{t} =$ total amount of hazardous waste generated and treated in year $t$

justificacion_global: |
  Chemicals are part of everyday life. There are over 140,000 different substances 
  used in all economic sectors globally. Their benefits are many and so too are their 
  potential to adversely impact human health and the environment if not properly managed. 
  All countries, especially middle- and low-income countries, are facing the complex 
  challenge of managing hazardous waste according to international standards of good 
  practice. The situation is complicated by limited human, financial and/or technical 
  resources. 

  As such, action is needed to support the sustainable use of chemicals and environmentally 
  sound management of hazardous waste. There is also a rapid increase in the generation of 
  hazardous waste. 

  Where most of the conventional hazardous wastes are produced in industrial and manufacturing 
  operations, significantamounts are generated in non-industrial sectors, including sludge 
  from the healthcare sector; waste-water treatment plants, waste oils, and waste batteries. 

  There is also an increase in the complexity of products and unidentified hazardous components 
  like coatings, and/or items which are not hazardous (laminates and multi-layer packaging), 
  but present hazardousness in a variety of ways when improperly discarded and end up in air, 
  water or are burned.
