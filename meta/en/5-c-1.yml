  Adequate and effective financing is essential to achieve SDG 5 and gender-related 
  targets across the SDG framework. By tracking and making public gender equality 
  allocations, governments promote greater transparency which can support stronger 
  accountability.
 
  The indicator encourages governments to put in place a system to track and make public 
  resource allocations which can then inform policy review, better policy formulation, 
  and more effective public financial management. 

  The principle of adequate financing for gender equality is rooted in the Beijing 
  Declaration and Platform of Action (para 345 and 346) adopted in 1995. However, 
  the Secretary General’s report on the twentyyear review and appraisal of the Platform 
  for Action found that underinvestment in gender equality and women’s empowerment has 
  contributed to slow and uneven progress in all 12 critical areas of concern. 
  Inadequate financing hinders the implementation of gender-responsive laws and policies. 

  Data shows that financing gaps are sometimes as high as 90% with critical shortfalls 
  in infrastructure, productive and economic sectors.
