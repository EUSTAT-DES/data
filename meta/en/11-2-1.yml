  This indicator aims to successfully monitor the use of and access to the 
  public transportation system and the move towards easing the reliance on 
  the private means of transportation, improving the access to areas with a 
  high proportion of transport disadvantaged groups such as elderly citizens, 
  physically challenged individuals, and low-income earners or areas with 
  specific dwelling types such as high occupancy buildings or public housing 
  and reducing the need for mobility by decreasing the number of trips and the 
  distances travelled. 

  The accessibility based urban mobility paradigm also critically needs good, 
  high-capacity public transport systems that are well integrated in a multimodal 
  arrangement with public transport access points located within comfortable walking 
  or cycling distances from homes and jobs for all.
