  The purpose of this indicator is to show the degree to which water resources 
  are being exploited to meet the country's water demand. It measures a country's 
  pressure on its water resources and therefore the challenge on the sustainability 
  of its water use. It tracks progress regarding “withdrawals and supply of 
  freshwater to address water scarcity”, i.e. the environmental component of target 6.4. 

  The indicator shows to what extent water resources are already used, and signals the 
  importance of effective supply and demand management policies. It indicates the 
  likelihood of increasing competition and conflict between different water uses and users 
  in a situation of increasing water scarcity. Increased water stress, shown by an increase 
  in the value of the indicator, has potentially negative effects on the sustainability 
  of the natural resources and on economic development. On the other hand, low values of 
  the indicator indicate that water does not represent a particular challenge for economic 
  development and sustainability.
