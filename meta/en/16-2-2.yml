  Number of detected victims of human trafficking for sexual exploitation, labour exploitation, removal of organ, forced marriages, forced crime and/or begging per 100,000 inhabitants

formula: |

  $$TVTP^{t} = \frac{VTP_{sexual\, exp}^{t}+VTP_{labour\, exp}^{t}+VTP_{organ\, removal}^{t}+VTP_{other\, purposes}^{t}}{P^{t}} \cdot 100.000$$ 

  where:

  $VTP_{sexual\, exp}^{t} =$ number of detected victims of human trafficking for sexual exploitation in year $t$ 

  $VTP_{labour\, exp}^{t} =$ number of detected victims of human trafficking for labour exploitation in year $t$ 

  $VTP_{organ\, removal}^{t} =$ number of detected victims of human trafficking for removal of organ in year $t$ 

  $VTP_{other\, purposes}^{t} =$ number of detected victims of human trafficking for forced marriages, forced crime and/or begging in year $t$ 
  
  $P^{t} =$ population as of July 1 of the year $t$ 


desagregacion: |
  Type of exploitation: sexual exploitation; labour exploitation; removal of organ; other purposes (forced marriages, forced crime and begging) 


observaciones: |

  The indicator may be somewhat overestimated, as the same person may have been detected as a victim of human 
  trafficking in two or more different types of exploitation, and their identification is not possible for 
  confidentiality reasons. Likewise, the indicator may be somewhat overestimated at the state level, as the same 
  person may have been detected as a victim of human trafficking in two or more different autonomous communities, 
  and their identification is not possible for confidentiality reasons. 

  Human trafficking: recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat 
  or use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or a position of vulnerability, 
  or the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another, 
  for the purpose of exploitation. Such exploitation shall include, as a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution 
  of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, 
  servitude or the removal of organs.

justificacion_global: |
  Trafficking in persons is a serious crime and a grave violation of human rights. Every day, victims are 
  exploited in restaurants, farms, construction sites, brothels, factories, markets, mines and in people’s 
  homes everywhere, but little is known about the prevalence and characteristics of the crime. Better data 
  is needed to inform more effective responses, and provide policymakers and practitioners with the 
  information and analysis they need to sharpen anti-trafficking action and improve prevention. 

  This indicator aims to measure the prevalence of trafficking in persons according to the victims profile 
  and the forms of exploitation, and to track global, regional, and national progress in combatting this 
  crime.
