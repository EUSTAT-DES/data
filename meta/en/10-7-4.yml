  $$TR^{t} = \frac{R^{t}}{P^{t+1}} \cdot 100.000$$

  where:

  $PR^{t} =$ people with a refugee identity document, subsidiary protection identity document or temporary residence authorization
  due to exceptional circumstances in force on December 31 of the year $t$

observaciones:

  It should be noted that the breakdown by autonomous communities of the number 
  of people who have been granted refugee status or a similar international 
  protection status in Spain is not based on place of residence, but rather on 
  the location where the administrative procedure that gave rise to that status 
  was carried out.

  Forced displacement as a result of conflict, violence, and other causes 
  undermine sustainable development, and can increase the risk of regional 
  instability, especially when refugees are hosted in neighbouring countries, 
  resulting in possible tensions with local populations. 

  The United Nations General Assembly Resolution (A/Res/70/1) that adopted 
  the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at paragraph 23 recognizes 
  the relevance of the Agenda to meet the needs of refugees, internally displaced 
  persons and migrants on the basis that they are among the most vulnerable. It 
  also explicitly states that Member States resolve to take further effective 
  measures and actions, to strengthen support and meet the special needs of 
  people living in areas affected by complex humanitarian emergencies. 

   In addition, target 10.7 recognizes for the first time the contribution 
  of migration to sustainable development by aiming to facilitate orderly, 
  safe, and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through 
  implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies. 

  This indicator tracks the number of people displaced across national borders 
  as a result of persecution, conflict, violence, human rights violations, or 
  events seriously disturbing public order. It measures the total count of refugee 
  population by country or territory of origin as a proportion of the total population.
