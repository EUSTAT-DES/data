  This indicator measures the prevalence of armed conflicts and their impact in terms of loss of life. 
  Together with the indicator 16.1.1 on intentional homicide, they measure violent deaths that occur in all 
  countries of the world (intentional homicides) and in situations of armed conflict (conflict-related 
  deaths). 

  The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development seeks to strengthen universal peace and commits to 
  redouble efforts to resolve or prevent conflict. It recognizes that there can be no sustainable 
  development without peace and no peace without sustainable development. Counting deaths occurring 
  in situations of armed conflict is therefore essential to the measurement of the Agenda, including and 
  beyond its Goal 16. 
  
   Monitoring conflict-related deaths is also necessary to help protect civilians and other 
  potential victims, ensure respect of humanitarian and human rights standards, and understand the 
  patterns and consequences of armed conflicts in order to prevent future armed conflicts.
