justificacion_global: |
  The purpose of the indicator is to measure the amount of time women and men spend doing unpaid 
  work, to ensure that all work, whether paid or unpaid, is valued. 

  In addition, it also provides an assessment of gender equality, by highlighting discrepancies 
  between how much time women and men spend on unpaid work, like cooking, cleaning, or taking 
  care of children. 

  This indicator measures the average amount of time as a proportion in a day, so that if for a given 
  country it is reported that women aged 15+ spend 10% of their day on unpaid domestic chores while men 
  in the same age group spend 1%, it indicates that women spend 2.4 hours (2 hours and 24 minutes), 
  while men spend 14.4 minutes on it a day, on average. As explained further in 4.c, this daily average is 
  obtained from an average taken over the reference period for the data collection, and thus not mean 
  that women and men spend these given amounts of time every single day.
