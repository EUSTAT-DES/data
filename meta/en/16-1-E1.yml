justificacion_global: |
  The indicator shows the share of the population who reported facing a problem of crime, violence or 
  vandalism in their local area. This describes the situation where the respondent feels crime, violence 
  or vandalism in the area to be a problem for the household, although this perception is not necessarily 
  based on personal experience. 

  On 24 July 2020, the European Commission presented a new EU Security Union Strategy for the period 2020-2025, 
  which replaces the previous security strategy set out in the European Agenda on Security (2015-2020). As a 
  central component of the strategy, the Commission defines a new way forward on internal security with actions 
  in key areas: organized crime; terrorism and preventing violent radicalization; resilience of our critical 
  infrastructure and public spaces; cybercrime, including the fight against child sexual abuse; police cooperation 
  and information sharing; and research and innovation. 

  Safety is a crucial aspect in people’s lives. Insecurity of any kind is a source of fear and worry, which 
  negatively affect quality of life. Physical insecurity includes all the external factors that could potentially 
  put the individual’s physical integrity in danger. Criminal actions are one of the most obvious abuses of insecurity. 
  Analyses of physical insecurity usually combine both subjective and objective aspects – the subjective perception 
  of insecurity and the objective lack of safety as measured by crime statistics. This indicator therefore complements 
  the indicator on homicide rates by focussing on the perception of insecurity.
