  SDG indicator 16.7.2 refers to the concept of ‘political efficacy’, which dates back to the 1950s, when the 
  concept was discussed jointly with political trust as a key measure of the overall health of a democratic 
  system (Craig et al, 1990). It can be defined as the “feeling that political and social change is possible and 
  that the individual citizen can play a part in bringing about this change" (Campbell, Gurin and Miller, 1954, 
  p.187). 

  This perception that people can impact decision-making is important as it makes it worthwhile for 
  them to perform their civic duties (Acok et al, 1985). 

  The ability to participate in society, to have a say in the shaping of policies and to dissent without fear are 
  essential freedoms. Political voice also provides a corrective to public policy: it can ensure the 
  accountability of officials and public institutions, reveal what people need and value, and call attention to 
  significant deprivations. 

  Political voice also reduces the potential for conflicts and enhances the prospect 
  of building consensus on key issues, with payoffs for economic efficiency, social equity, and inclusiveness 
  in public life.
