  Total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, total GHG emissions per unit of real GDP, per capita, 
  and rates of change relative to emissions in the years 1990 and 2005 

formula:  |

  <b>Total greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP</b>

  $$PPIBGEI^{t} = \frac{GEI^{t}}{PIB_{2022}^{t}} $$

  <b>Total greenhouse gas emissions per capita</b>

  $$GEIPC^{t} = \frac{GEI^{t}}{P^{t}} $$

  <b>Greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990</b>

  $$TVGEI_{1990}^{t} = \frac{GEI^{t}-GEI^{1990}}{GEI^{1990}} \cdot 100$$ 

  <b>Greenhouse gas emissions compared to 2005</b>

  $$TVGEI_{2005}^{t} = \frac{GEI^{t}-GEI^{2005}}{GEI^{2005}} \cdot 100$$ 


  where:

  $GEI^{t} =$ greenhouse gas emissions in year $t$

  $PIB_{2022}^{t} =$ gross domestic product in chained volume with reference to 2022 en el año $t$

  $P^{t} =$ population as of July 1 of year $t$

  $GEI^{1990} =$ greenhouse gas emissions in 1990

  $GEI^{2005} =$ greenhouse gas emissions in 2005

justificacion_global: |
  The ultimate objective of the Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC) is to achieve the stabilization of 
  greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous 
  anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Estimating the levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) 
  emissions and removals is an important element of the efforts to achieve this objective. 

  The Paris Agreement adopted in 2015 marks the latest step in the evolution of the UN climate change 
  regime and builds on the work undertaken under the Convention. Its central aim is to strengthen the 
  global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well 
  below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature 
  increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Agreement also aims to strengthen the ability of 
  countries to deal with the impacts of climate change. 

  The indicator is part of the EU Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicator set. The European Climate 
  Law sets out a framework for climate action and increases the EU’s ambition for 2030, with a new goal 
  to reduce net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 55 % by that year (compared to 1990) and to 
  achieve climate-neutrality by 2050. 

  The year 1990 is used as the reference year in most international climate agreements (Kyoto, United 
  Nations). The year 2005 is the base year used by the Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Effort Sharing Directive 
  (ETS, EU Emissions Trading System) due to the greater availability of detailed sectoral data from that 
  date onwards.
