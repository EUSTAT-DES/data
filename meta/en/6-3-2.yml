definicion: |

  The indicator is defined as the proportion of water bodies in a territory that 
  have good environmental water quality. Environmental water quality refers to natural, 
  untreated water in rivers, lakes, and groundwater and represents a combination of 
  natural influences along with the impacts of all anthropogenic activities. 

  3 series are presented for different water bodies: 

    - rivers
    - groundwater
    - surface waters (includes coastal waters, transitional waters, reservoirs, lakes and wetlands, and rivers)


formula: |

  $$PMABC^{t} = \frac{MBC_{water}^{t}}{M_{water}^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $MBC_{water}^{t} =$ good quality water bodies in year $t$

  $M_{water}^{t} =$ total number of water bodies evaluated in year $t$

observaciones: |
  
  The assessment of surface waters (ecological status) is carried out according to Directive 2000/60/EC 
  of the European Parliament and of the Council. 

  Groundwater assessment is carried out according to the Guide for the Assessment of the Status of 
  Surface and Groundwater, approved by Instruction of October 14, 2020, from the Secretary of State 
  for the Environment (SEMA). 

  The water body census corresponds to the water bodies that have a significant presence within the 
  Autonomous Community of the Basque Country in accordance with Royal Decree 35/2023, of January 24, 
  which approves the revision of the hydrological plans of the Western Cantabrian, Guadalquivir, Ceuta, 
  Melilla, Segura, and Júcar river basins, and of the Spanish part of the Eastern Cantabrian, Miño-Sil, 
  Duero, Tajo, Guadiana, and Ebro river basins. 

  For the indicated period, the evaluations correspond to status reviews using uniform criteria in 
  accordance with Royal Decree 35/2023 and the technical advances that have occurred.

  Good ambient water quality is essential for protecting aquatic ecosystems and the services 
  they provide, including: the preservation of biodiversity; the protection of human health 
  during recreational use and through the provision of drinking water; the support of human 
  nutrition through the provision of fish and water for irrigation; the enabling of a variety 
  of economic activities; and the strengthening of the resilience of people against water-related 
  disasters. Good ambient water quality is therefore closely linked to the achievement of many 
  other Sustainable Development Goals. 

  Target 6.3 aims at improving water quality and indicator 6.3.2 provides a mechanism for determining 
  whether, and to which extent, water quality management measures are contributing to the improvement 
  of water quality over time. The indicator is also directly linked to indicator 6.3.1 on wastewater 
  treatment because inadequate wastewater treatment leads to degradation in quality of the waters 
  receiving the wastewater effluents. 

  It directly informs progress towards target 6.3 and is strongly linked to target 6.6 on water-related 
  ecosystems, as well as target 14.1 on marine pollution (coastal eutrophication).
