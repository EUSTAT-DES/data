  The indicator is composed of several series:

   - <b>Tourist overnight stays per inhabitant:</b> Resident and non-resident tourist 
      overnight stays in the Autonomous Community, including residents abroad, as a percentage of the population

   - <b>Overnight stays of non-resident tourists per inhabitant:</b> Non-resident tourist overnight stays in 
     the Autonomous Community, including residents abroad, as a percentage of the population

   - <b>Proportion of overnight stays by tourists in the two months of maximum occupancy over the total overnight stays by tourists:</b> Proportion of resident and non-resident tourist overnight 
      stays in the Autonomous Community, including residents abroad, in the two months of peak occupancy as a percentage of the annual total

   - <b>Proportion of overnight stays by non-resident tourists in the two months of maximum occupancy over the total overnight stays by non-resident tourists:</b> Proportion 
      of non-resident tourist overnight stays in the Autonomous Community, including residents abroad, in the two months maximum occupancy over its annual total

formula:  |

  <b>Tourist overnight stays per inhabitant</b>

  $$PERNP^{t} = \frac{{PERN^{t}}}{P^{t}}$$

  where:

  $PERN^{t} =$ overnight stays of resident and non-resident tourists in year $t$

  $P^{t} =$ population as of July 1, year $t$

  <br>

  <b>Overnight stays of non-resident tourists per inhabitant</b>

  $$PERNP_{non\, residents}^{t} = \frac{{PERN_{non\, residents}^{t}}}{P^{t}}$$

  where:

  $PERN_{non\, residents}^{t} =$ overnight stays of non-resident tourists in year $t$

  $P^{t} =$ population as of July 1, year $t$

  <br>

  <b>Proportion of overnight stays by tourists in the two months of maximum occupancy over the total overnight stays by tourists</b>


  $$PERNP_{2\, months\, max}^{t} = \frac{{PERN_{2\, months\, max}^{t}}}{PERN^{t}}$$

  where:

  $PERN_{2\, months\, max}^{t} =$ overnight stays by resident and non-resident tourists in the two months of peak occupancy of the year $t$

  $PERN^{t} =$ overnight stays by resident and non-resident tourists in year $t$

  <br>

  <b>Proportion of overnight stays by non-resident tourists in the two months of maximum occupancy over the total overnight 
    stays by non-resident tourists</b>


  $$PERNP_{non\, residents\, 2\, months\, max}^{t} = \frac{{PERN_{non\, residents\, 2\, meses\, months}^{t}}}{PERN_{non\, residents}^{t}}$$

  where:

  $PERN_{non\, residents\, 2\, meses\, months}^{t} =$ overnight stays by non-resident tourists in the two months of peak occupancy of the year $t$

  $PERN_{non\, residents}^{t} =$ overnight stays by non-resident tourists in year $t$
