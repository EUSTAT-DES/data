  Globally, land cover today is altered principally by direct human use: 
  by agriculture and livestock raising, forest harvesting and management 
  and urban and suburban construction and development. A defining feature 
  of many of the world’s cities is an outward expansion far beyond formal 
  administrative boundaries, largely propelled by the use of the automobile, 
  poor urban and regional planning and land speculation. 

  A large proportion of cities both from developed and developing countries 
  have high consuming suburban expansion patterns, which often extend to even 
  further peripheries. A global study on 120 cities shows that urban land cover 
  has, on average, grown more than three times as much as the urban population; 
  in some cases similar studies at national level showed a difference that was 
  three to five times fold. 

  In order to effectively monitor land consumption growth, it is not only necessary 
  to have the information on existing land use cover but also the capability to 
  monitor the dynamics of land use resulting out of both changing demands of increasing 
  population and forces of nature acting to shape the landscape.
