definicion: | 

  The indicator reflects the proportion of people actually covered by a social protection system. The data are presented in different series to distinguish
  between the different components of the social protection system. For each case, coverage is expressed as a percentage of the respective population.  


  Available series: 

  <b>Proportion of unemployed people receiving unemployment benefits:</b>
  Ratio of unemployment benefit recipients to the number of unemployed
  
  <b>Proportion of the population that exceeds the legal retirement age and receives a pension:</b>
  Ratio of persons over the legal retirement age who receive a pension (contributory or non-contributory) to persons over the legal retirement age 

formula: |

  <b>Proportion of unemployed people receiving unemployment benefits</b>

  $$PP_{unemployed}^{t} = \frac{P_{unemployment\, benefit}^{t}}{P_{unemployment}^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $P_{unemployment\, benefit}^{t} =$ Population receiving unemployment benefits in $t$

  $P_{unemployed}^{t} =$ unemployed population in $t$

  <br>

  <b>Proportion of the population that exceeds the legal retirement age and receives a pension</b>

  $$PP_{retired}^{t} = \frac{P_{pension\,retirement\, age}^{t}}{P_{retirement\, age}^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $P_{pension\,retirement\, age} =$ population that exceeds the legal retirement age and receives a pension in $t$

  $PP_{retirement\, age}^{t} =$ Population over the legal retirement age on 1 July $t$

observaciones:

  The series "Proportion of unemployed persons receiving unemployment benefits" should be taken with caution and
  should not be interpreted as the proportion of unemployed persons who receive a benefit, since a
  high volume of permanent discontinuous workers can lead to a high coverage rate, even above 100.

justificacion_global: |

  The United Nations indicator aims to reflect the proportion of people
  effectively covered by a social protection system, including
  minimum levels of social protection. It also reflects the main
  components of social protection (child and maternity benefits,
  support for the unemployed, people with disabilities, victims of
  occupational accidents and the elderly). Effective coverage of the
  Social protection is measured by the number of people who contribute
  actively to a social insurance plan or receive benefits (contributory or
  non-contributory).

  Access to at least a basic level of social protection
  throughout the life cycle is a human right. The principle of
  The universality of social protection shows the importance of the social protection
  systems to guarantee decent living conditions for all the population, throughout their lives.
  The proportion of the population covered by social protection systems provides
  an indication of the extent to which universality is achieved, and therefore of how safe
  the living conditions of the population are
