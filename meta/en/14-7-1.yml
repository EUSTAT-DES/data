  Although target 14.7 promotes the sustainable use of marine resources “including of fisheries, 
  aquaculture and tourism”, this indicator as selected by the IAEG-SDG focuses only on the sustainable use 
  of marine resources by fisheries. The methodology hereby proposed by FAO thus measures sustainable 
  fisheries as a percentage of GDP, in accordance with the agreed indicator formulation. 

  The share of value added from an industry in GDP is commonly used as an indication of its economic 
  importance. Accordingly, the value added of marine capture fisheries indicates the prominence of marine 
  fish related activities in the country’s economy and its importance for livelihoods. Both GDP and the VA 
  are measured in constant prices and domestic currency.
