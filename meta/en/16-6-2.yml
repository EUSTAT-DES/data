justificacion_global: |
  Governments have an obligation to provide a wide range of public services that should meet the 
  expectations of their citizens in terms of access, responsiveness and reliability/quality. 

  When citizens cannot afford some essential services, when their geographic or electronic access to services and 
  information is difficult, when the services provided do not respond to their needs and are of poor quality, 
  citizens will naturally tend to report lower satisfaction not only with these services, but also with public 
  institutions and governments. 

  In this regard, it has been shown that citizens’ experience with front-line 
  public services affects their trust in public institutions (OECD 2017, Trust and Public Policy – How Better 
  Governance Can Help Rebuild Public Trust; Eurofound 2018, Societal change and trust in institutions). 

  Mindful of this close connection between service provision/performance, citizen satisfaction and public 
  trust, governments are increasingly interested in better understanding citizens’ needs, experiences and 
  preferences to be able to provide better targeted services, including for underserved populations. 

  Measuring satisfaction with public services is at the heart of a citizen-centered approach to service delivery 
  and an important outcome indicator of overall government performance.
