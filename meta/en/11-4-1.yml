justificacion_global: | 

  This indicator measures the per capita expenditure (public and private) 
  in the preservation, protection and conservation of cultural and/or natural 
  heritage over time. To monitor change over time of national efforts for the 
  protection and safeguard of cultural and/or natural heritage. 

  This indicator illustrates how financial efforts/actions made by public 
  authorities, both at the local, national and international levels, alone or 
  in partnership with civil society organizations (CSO) and the private sector, 
  to protect and safeguard the world’s cultural and natural heritage has a direct 
  impact in making cities and human settlements more sustainable. 

  This means that cultural resources and assets are safeguarded to keep attracting/to 
  attract people (inhabitants, workers, tourists, etc.) and financial investments, to 
  ultimately enhance the total amount of expenditure. 

  This indicator is a proxy to measure the target. This indicator would allow insight 
  into whether or not countries are strengthening their efforts into safeguarding 
  their cultural and natural heritage. It will help to identify areas that require 
  more attention for policy purposes.
