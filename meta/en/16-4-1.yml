  A major challenge to sustainable development of societies around the world, particularly in developing 
  countries, is represented by several criminal activities and tax and commercial illicit practices which are at 
  the origin or associated with illicit financial flows (IFFs). 

  Proceeds from criminal activities are often transferred between countries to be laundered, utilized and 
  reinvested in licit or illicit activities. IFFs can also originate from legal economic activities but 
  become illicit when financial flows are managed or transferred illicitly; for instance, to evade taxes or 
  to finance illegal activities. IFFs drain resources from sustainable development. 

  Combatting IFFs is therefore a crucial component of the goal to promote peace, justice and strong institutions, 
  as set out in Goal 16 of its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
