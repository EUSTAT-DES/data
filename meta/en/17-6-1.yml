  Number of fixed broadband lines in relation to the number of inhabitants

formula: |

  $$TLBAF^{t} = \frac{LBAF^{t}}{P^{t}}  \cdot 100$$

  where: 

  $LBAF^{t} =$  fixed broadband lines in year $t$

  $P^{t} =$ population as of January 1 of the year $t$

justificacion_global: |
  The Internet has become an increasingly important tool to provide access to information, and can help 
  foster and enhance regional and international cooperation on, and access to, science, technology and 
  innovations, and enhance knowledge sharing. 

  High-speed Internet access is important to ensure that 
  Internet users have quality access to the Internet and can take advantage of the growing amount of 
  Internet content – including user-generated content –, services and information. 

  While the number of fixed-broadband subscriptions has increased substantially over the last years and 
  while service providers offer increasingly higher speeds, fixed Internet broadband can vary tremendously 
  by speed, thus affecting the quality and functionality of Internet access. 

  Many countries, especially in the 
  developing world, have not only a very limited amount of fixed-broadband subscriptions, but also at very 
  low speeds. This limitation is a barrier to the Target 17.6 and the indicator highlights the potential of the 
  Internet (especially through high-speed access) to enhance cooperation, improve access to science, 
  technology and innovation, and share knowledge. 

  The indicator also highlights the importance of Internet 
  use as a development enabler and helps to measure the digital divide, which, if not properly addressed, 
  will aggravate inequalities in all development domains. Information on fixed broadband subscriptions by 
  speed will contribute to the design of targeted policies to overcome those divides.
