definicion: |
  Gross Operating Income of small and large agricultural holdings.

  An agricultural holding is considered small when it meets both conditions:
   - It operates an amount of land that falls within the first two quintiles (the bottom 40%) 
     of the cumulative distribution of land size at the level of the Autonomous Community of 
     the Basque Country (measured in hectares).
   - Obtains an annual income from agricultural activities that falls within the first two 
     quintiles (the bottom 40%) of the cumulative distribution of agricultural income per unit 
     of production at the level of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country.

  If an agricultural holding does not meet any of these conditions, it is considered large.

formula: |

  $$IBM^{t} = SE131^{t} - SE275^{t} - SE365^{t}$$

  where:

  $SE131^{t}$ = Total production of crops and derivatives, livestock and livestock products, 
  and other production in the year $t$

  $SE275^{t}$ = specific costs of crops and livestock as well as general costs in the year $t$

  $SE365^{t}$ = Compensation for factors of production (labor, land, and capital) that are not 
  owned by the farmer (wages, rent, and interest paid) in the year $t$

justificacion_global: |

  The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda has emphasized the importance of enhancing 
  productivity of small-scale food producers, as these producers play an important role 
  in the global production of food. The indicator monitors progress in this area, where 
  the target is to double productivity by year 2030.

  The enhancement of labour productivity in small-scale production units also has 
  implications on poverty reduction, as small-scale food producers are often poor, 
  and are frequently found to be close to subsistence conditions.
