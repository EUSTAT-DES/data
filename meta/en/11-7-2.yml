  Non-sexual harassment includes harassment against the freedom of persons (Article 172 ter of the 
  Criminal Code), real estate harassment (Article 172.1.3 of the Criminal Code), and workplace or 
  public servant harassment (Article 173.1 of the Criminal Code). 


  The data comes from police action statistics, which cover known crimes, victims, and suspects.
  Since the data summarizes only cases reported to the police, the figures may underestimate the reality.

justificacion_global: |
  The experience of non-sexual and sexual harassment can have far-reaching 
  negative impacts on the victims. 

  Besides the emotional and psychological harm suffered, harassment can have 
  negative consequences on the ability of its victims to fully participate in 
  public life and to share in and contribute to the development of their communities. 
  For example, the widespread occurrence of sexual harassment in the workplace can 
  lead to a lower participation of women in the workforce, especially in maledominated 
  occupations, and lower their income-generating capacity.

comparabilidad: >-
  The available indicator does not comply with the metadata of the United Nations indicator, 
  but provides complementary information. The United Nations indicator measures the prevalence of 
  harassment in the population based on a population survey, while the indicator available in the Basque 
  Country is based on administrative records that may underestimate reality.
