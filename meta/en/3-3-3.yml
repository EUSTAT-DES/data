definicion: >-
  Autochthonous cases of malaria notified to the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE) per 1,000 inhabitants.

formula: |

  $$TCA_{malaria}^{t} = \frac{CA_{malaria}^{t}}{P^{t}} \cdot 1.000$$

  where:

  $CA_{malaria}^{t} =$ autochthonous cases of malaria notified to the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE) in year $t$

  $P^{t} =$ population on July 1 of year $t$

  Autochthonous cases are those in which the disease has been contracted in the national territory. The Autonomous Community of the Basque 
  Country is not currently a malaria transmission area.

justificacion_global: |

  The objective is to measure trends in malaria morbidity and to identify locations where 
  the risk of disease is highest.  With this information, programmes can respond to unusual 
  trends, such as epidemics, and direct resources to the populations most in need. These data 
  also serves to inform global resource allocation for malaria such as when defining eligibility 
  criteria for Global Fund finance.

  Incidence of malaria is defined as the number of new cases of malaria per 1,000 people at risk 
  each year. A case of malaria is defined as the occurrence of malaria infection in a person in 
  whom the presence of malaria parasites in the blood has been confirmed by a diagnostic test. 
  The population considered is the population at risk of the disease.
