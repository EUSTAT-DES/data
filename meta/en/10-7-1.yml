  The high economic and social costs incurred by migrants are increasingly 
  recognized as serious impediments to realizing sustainable development 
  outcomes from international migration. A critical role of migration policies 
  is reducing the financial costs of recruitment incurred by migrant workers 
  seeking jobs abroad. 

  Recruitment costs paid by migrant workers to recruitment agents, on top of 
  the fees paid by the employers, are a major drain on poor migrants’ incomes 
  and remittances. They divert the money sent by migrants from the family to 
  illicit recruitment agents and money lenders. Almost 10 million people use 
  regular channels to migrate in search of employment every year. A large number 
  of them pay illegal recruitment fees to the recruitment agents.
