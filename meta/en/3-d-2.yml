  Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat to health, livelihoods, 
  food security and the achievement of many of the Sustainable Development 
  Goals. Antibiotics, antivirals, antiparasitic agents and antifungals are 
  increasingly ineffective owing to resistance developed through their excessive 
  or inappropriate use, with serious consequences for human and animal health 
  (terrestrial and aquatic), and plant health, and negative impacts on food production, 
  the environment and the global economy. 

  In particular, antimicrobial resistance will negatively impact the achievement 
  of many of the targets listed under Goal 3 due to reduced treatment options for 
  infections by resistant pathogens; will impact targets under Goal 2 by impacting 
  the agricultural productivity, including food animal production; and will impact 
  targets in Goal 1 as increased antimicrobial resistance will result in large declines 
  in economic growth, increase economic inequality and drive an additional 24 million 
  people into extreme poverty by 2030.
