justificacion_global: | 

  Addressing social inclusion and inequality is important on the global development 
  agenda as well as on the national development agenda of many countries. The share 
  of the population living below 50% of median national income is a measure that is 
  useful for monitoring the level and trends in social inclusion, relative poverty 
  and inequality within a country. 

  The share of people living below 50% of the median is an indicator of relative 
  poverty and inequality of the income distribution within a country. 

  This indicator and similar relative measures are commonly used for poverty measurement 
  in rich countries (including Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s 
  (OECD) poverty indicators and Eurostat’s indicators of risk of poverty or social exclusion) 
  and are increasingly also used as a complementary measure of inequality and poverty in low- 
  and middle- income countries.
