  While Target 16.4 aims at significantly reducing illicit arms flows, directly measuring these types of flows 
  is extremely difficult due to the underground nature of illicit arms trafficking. 

  Therefore, the indicator does not aim at measuring these flows, but the efficiency with which the international 
  community combats the phenomenon of illicit arms trafficking. 

  In addition to indicator 16.4.2 as defined in this document, other non-official indicators may be of 
  assistance when interpreting the reporting values for Goal 16.4. In particular, information is collected on 
  the number of international and national tracing requests placed and responded to, and the total number 
  of arms seized, found and surrendered by whether they are uniquely marked or not, the total number of 
  arms that have been marked, recorded or destroyed. 

  In addition, data on the number of individuals in
  contact with the police, prosecuted and convicted, in relation to illicit trafficking of arms is available. All 
  these indicators could help complete the picture regarding the extent of Law Enforcement activities at 
  the national level to counter illicit trafficking in arms.
