  Coastal areas are areas of high productivity where inputs from land, sea, air and people converge. With 
  over 40 percent of the human population residing in coastal areas, ecosystem degradation in these areas 
  can have disproportionate effects on society (IGOS, 2006). 

  One of the largest pressures on coastal environments is eutrophication, resulting primarily from 
  land-based nutrient input from agricultural runoff and domestic wastewater discharge. Coastal 
  eutrophication can lead to serious damage to marine ecosystems, vital sea habitats, and can cause 
  the spread of harmful algal blooms. 

  Marine litter is found in all the world’s oceans and seas. It constitutes an increasing risk to 
  ecosystem health and biodiversity while entailing substantial economic costs through its impacts 
  on public health, tourism, fishing and aquaculture. Marine plastics are of particular interest due 
  to the fact that in the last 50 years, plastic production has increased more than 22-fold while the 
  global recycling rate of plastics in 2015 was only an estimated 9%. This rise in plastic production 
  and unmanaged plastic waste has resulted a growing threat to marine environments with an estimated 
  5-13 million tons of plastic from land-based sources ending up in marine environments. 

  Target 14.1 aims to reduce the impacts of pollution through prevention and reduction of marine pollution 
  of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution.
