  $DIR_{men}^{t} =$ men in the corresponding occupation in the year $t$

  Management positions are defined as all occupations included in Group 1 of the CNO-2011, while senior 
  management occupations are defined as those belonging to subgroups 11, 12, and 13 of the CNO-2011. 

  Group 1 of the CNO-2011 includes administration and management jobs, whose main tasks are to plan, 
  direct and coordinate the general activity of companies, governments or other organisations, and to 
  formulate and review company strategies and government legislation. This group is subdivided into 
  five main subgroups: 

  11 Members of the executive power and of the legislative bodies; directors of the Public Administration 
  and social interest organisations
  12 Directors of administrative and commercial departments
  13 Directors of production and operations
  14 Directors and managers of accommodation, catering and trading companies
  15 Directors and managers of other companies offering services not classified in other sections

  Women entrepreneurs are those who are self-employed. 
 

 # Metadatos mundiales (Descripción del indicador)  


justificacion_global: |

  The indicator provides information on the proportion of women who are employed in decision-making 
  and management roles in government, large enterprises and institutions, thus providing some insight into 
  women’s power in decision making and in the economy (especially compared to men's power in those 
  areas).

  It is recommended to use two different measures jointly for this indicator: the share of females 
  in (total) management and the share of females in senior and middle management (thus excluding junior 
  management). The joint calculation of these two measures provides information on whether women are 
  more represented in junior management than in senior and middle management, thus pointing to an 
  eventual ceiling for women to access higher-level management positions. In these cases, calculating only 
  the share of women in (total) management would be misleading, in that it would suggest that women 
  hold positions with more decision-making power and responsibilities than they actually do.
