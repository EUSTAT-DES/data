  $VP_{running\, water}^{t} =$ main family dwellings with running water supply in year $t$

  $VP^{t} =$ main family dwellings in year $t$

  <br>

  <b>Proportion of homes with a bathroom</b>

  $$PVP_{bathroom}^{t} = \frac{VP_{bathroom}^{t}}{VP^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $VP_{bathroom}^{t} =$ main family dwellings with a bathroom in year $t$

  $VP^{t} =$ main family dwellings in year $t$

  Access to safe sanitation and hygiene services is essential 
  for good health, welfare and productivity and is  widely recognized 
  as a human right. Unsafe management of human excreta and poor 
  sanitation practices are closely associated with diarrhoeal diseases, 
  which exacerbate malnutrition and remain a major public health concern 
  and a leading global cause of child deaths, as well as parasitic infections 
  such as soil  transmitted helminths (worms) and a range of other neglected 
  tropical diseases. While access to a hygienic toilet facility is essential 
  for reducing the transmission of pathogens, it is equally important to ensure 
  safe management, treatment and disposal of the excreta produced. 
  
  Sharing of sanitation facilities is also an important consideration given 
  the negative impacts on dignity, privacy and personal safety. Lack of access 
  to suitable sanitation and hygiene facilities is a major cause of risks and 
  anxiety, especially for women and girls. For all these reasons, access to 
  sanitation and hygiene services that prevent disease, provide privacy and ensure 
  dignity has been recognized as a basic human right. 
  
  The SDG target 6.2 relating to sanitation and hygiene aim to achieve this right 
  through universal access to safely managed services.
