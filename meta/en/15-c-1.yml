  There are over 35,000 species under international protection, so it is impossible to monitor all poaching. 
  Illegal trade, however, is an indirect indicator of poaching. Wildlife seizures represent concrete instances 
  of illegal trade, but the share of overall wildlife crime they represent is unknown and variable. In addition, 
  the number of species under international protection continues to grow. 

  Legal international trade in protected species, by definition, is 100% captured in the Convention on International 
  Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Trade Database, which now contains over 16 million
  records of trade in CITES-listed species. 

  To ground the illegal trade data in a complete indicator, the ratio of aggregated seizures to total trade is 
  estimated. An increase in the share of total wildlife trade that is illegal would be interpreted as a negative 
  indicator, and a decrease as a positive one.
