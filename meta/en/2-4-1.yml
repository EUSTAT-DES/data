definicion: |

  Proportion of agricultural land with a desirable or acceptable level of:
  - production per hectare
  - net income


formula: |

  <b>Proportion of agricultural area where a desirable or acceptable level of production per hectare has been achieved</b>

  $$PSANR_{\text{desirable or acceptable}}^{t} = \frac{SANR_{\text{desirable}}^{t} + SANR_{\text{acceptable}}^{t}}{SANR_{\text{desirable}}^{t} + SANR_{\text{acceptable}}^{t} + SANR_{\text{unsustainable}}^{t}}$$

  where:

  $SANR_{\text{desirable}}^{t}$ = Agricultural area corresponding to those agricultural holdings where 
  their production per hectare is greater than or equal to 2/3 of the 90th percentile of the production 
  per hectare of agricultural holdings in the same territory and technical-economic orientation (agriculture, 
  livestock, or mixed) in the year $t$

  $SANR_{\text{acceptable}}^{t}$ = Agricultural area corresponding to those agricultural holdings where 
  their production per hectare is less than two-thirds but greater than or equal to one-third of the 90th 
  percentile of the production per hectare of agricultutal holdings in the same territory and with a 
  technical-economic orientation (agriculture, livestock, or mixed) in the year $t$

  $SANR_{\text{unsustainable}}^{t}$ = Agricultural area corresponding to those agricultural holdings where 
  their production per hectare is less than 1/3 of the 90th percentile of the production per hectare of 
  agricultural holdings in the same territory and technical-economic orientation (agriculture, livestock, 
  or mixed) in the year $t$

  <b>Proportion of agricultural area where a desirable or acceptable level of net income has been achieved</b>

  $$PSANR_{\text{desirable or acceptable}}^{t} = 
    \frac{SANR_{\text{desirable}}^{t} + SANR_{\text{acceptable}}^{t}}
    {SANR_{\text{desirable}}^{t} + SANR_{\text{acceptable}}^{t} + SANR_{\text{unsustainable}}^{t}}$$


  where:

  $SANR_{\text{desirable}}^t$ = Agricultural area corresponding to those agricultural holdings where their net income has been positive in the years $t$, $t-1$ and $t-2$
    
  $SANR_{\text{acceptable}}^t$ = Agricultural area corresponding to those agricultural holdings where their net income has been positive in at least one of the years $t$, $t-1$ and $t-2$, but not in all of them
    
  $SANR_{\text{unsustainable}}^t$ = Agricultural area corresponding to those agricultural holdings where their net income has not been positive in any of the years $t$, $t-1$ and $t-2$

  When interpreting the series "Proportion of agricultural land with a desirable or acceptable level 
  of production per hectare", it should be noted that it is a relative indicator, since the productivity level 
  of an agricultural holding depends not only on its production per hectare, but also on the production per hectare 
  of agricultural holdings in the same territory and with the same technical and economic orientation 
  (agriculture, livestock, or mixed).

  When interpreting the series "Proportion of agricultural land with a desirable or acceptable level 
  of net income", it should be noted that it is an absolute indicator, since the profitability of an agricultural 
  holding depends exclusively on its net income over the past three years.

  The approaches to framing and defining sustainable agriculture vary in terms of their coverage of 
  the three primary dimensions of sustainability, i.e. economic, environmental and social, and in 
  terms of the scale that is used to assess sustainability, i.e. from field and farm scales, to national 
  and global scales. Some approaches consider different features of sustainability, for example whether 
  current practices are economically feasible, environmentally friendly and socially desirable. Other 
  approaches focus on particular practices such as organic, regenerative or low-input agriculture and 
  can equate these with sustainable agriculture.


  SDG indicator 2.4.1 is based on a set of sub-indicators that cover the three dimensions of sustainability:
   - Farm output value per hectare 
   - Net farm income 
   - Risk mitigation mechanisms
   - Prevalence of soil degradation 
   - Variation in water availability 
   - Management of fertilizers
   - Management of pesticides 
   - Use of agro-biodiversity-supportive practices 
   - Wage rate in agriculture 
   - Food Insecurity Experience Scale
   - Secure tenure rights to land
