   <b> - Percentage of participation in breast cancer screening programs among the target population (women aged 50-69)</b> 

formula: |
  <b>Percentage of participation in colorectal cancer screening programs among the target population (men and women aged 50 to 74)</b> 

  $$PP_{colorectal}^{t} = \frac{P_{colorectal}^{t}}{P_{T\, colorectal}^{t}} \cdot 100$$ 

  where:

  $P_{colorectal}^{t} =$ number of participants in the colorectal cancer early detection program in year $t$ 

  $P_{T\, colorectal}^{t} =$ target population of the colorectal cancer early detection program in year $t$ 


  <b>Percentage of participation in breast cancer screening programs among the target population (women aged 50-69)</b>


  $$PP_{breast}^{t} = \frac{P_{breast}^{t}}{P_{T\, breast}^{t}} \cdot 100$$ 

  where:

  $P_{breast}^{t} =$ number of participants in the breast cancer early detection program in year $t$ 

  $P_{T\, breast}^{t} =$ target population of the breast cancer early detection program in year $t$
