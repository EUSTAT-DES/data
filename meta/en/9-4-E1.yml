definicion: >- 
  PM10 and PM2.5 emissions per unit of added value in the manufacturing sector

formula: |

  $$PVABEPM_{manufacturing}^{t} = \frac{EPM_{manufacturing}^{t}}{VAB_{manufacturing\, 2022}^{t}} $$

  where:

  $EPM_{manufacturing}^{t} =$ emissions of suspended particles from the manufacturing sector in year $t$

  $VAB_{manufacturing\, 2022}^{t} =$ Gross added value of the manufacturing sector in chained volume with 
  reference to 2022 in year $t$

  The indicator is part of the EU Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicator set. 
  It is used to monitor progress towards  SDG 9 on industry, innovation and infrastructure; 
  which is embedded in the European Commission’s Priorities under the European Green Deal, 
  Economy that works for people and European way of life. 

  SDG 9 recognises the importance of technological progress and innovation for finding lasting 
  solutions to social, economic and environmental challenges such as the creation of new jobs 
  and promotion of resource and energy efficiency. To foster innovation and entrepreneurship, 
  SDG 9 also seeks to increase access to financial services for small-scale enterprises and to 
  bridge the digital divide by increasing access to information and communication technologies. 

  This indicator measures the emissions intensity of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) from the 
  manufacturing sector (NACE Rev. 2 sector ‘C’). Air emissions are defined as flows of gaseous and 
  particulate materials emitted into the atmosphere. 

  Fine and coarse particulates (PM10) are less than 10 micrometres in diameter and can be carried 
  deep into the lungs, where they can cause inflammation and exacerbate the condition of people 
  suffering from heart and lung diseases. 

  Fine particulates (PM2.5) are less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter and are therefore a subset 
  of the PM10 particles. Their negative health impacts are more serious than PM10 because they can 
  be drawn further into the lungs and may be more toxic. 

  Emission intensity is calculated by dividing the sector’s PM emissions by its gross value added 
  (GVA), which is defined as output (at basic prices) minus intermediate consumption (at purchaser 
  prices).
