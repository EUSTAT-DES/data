  Autochthonous cases of hepatitis B notified to the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE) per 100,000 inhabitants

formula: |

  $$TCA_{hepatitis B}^{t} = \frac{CA_{hepatitis B}^{t}}{P^{t}} \cdot 100.000$$

  where:

  $CA_{hepatitis B}^{t} =$ autochthonous cases of hepatitis B notified to the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE) in year $t$

  $P^{t} =$ population on July 1 of year $t$

  The purpose is to describe the reduction in chronic hepatitis b infections. Most of the burden of disease 
  from HBV infection comes from infections acquired before the age of 5 years. Therefore, prevention of 
  HBV infection focuses on children under 5 years of age. The United Nations selected the cumulative 
  incidence of chronic HBV infection at 5 years of age as an indicator of the Sustainable Development Goal 
  target for “combating hepatitis”. This indicator is measured indirectly through the proportion of children 
  5 years of age who have developed chronic HBV infection (i.e. the proportion that tests positive for a 
  marker of infection called hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]).

  This indicator is measured indirectly through the proportion of children 5 years of age who have 
  developed chronic HBV infection (i.e. the proportion that tests positive for a marker of infection called 
  hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]).
