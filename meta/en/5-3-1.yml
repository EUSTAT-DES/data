justificacion_global: |
  Marriage before the age of 18 is a fundamental violation of human rights. 
  Child marriage often compromises a girl’s development by resulting in early 
  pregnancy and social isolation, interrupting her schooling, limiting her 
  opportunities for career and vocational advancement and placing her at increased 
  risk of intimate partner violence. 

  In many cultures, girls reaching puberty are expected to assume gender roles 
  associated with womanhood. These include entering a union and becoming a mother. 
  The practice of early/child marriage is a direct manifestation of gender inequality. 

  The issue of child marriage is addressed in a number of international conventions 
  and agreements. Although marriage is not mentioned directly in the Convention on the 
  Rights of the Child, child marriage is linked to other rights – such as the right to 
  freedom of expression, the right to protection from all forms of abuse, and the right 
  to be protected from harmful traditional practices.
