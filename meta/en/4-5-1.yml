  Relationship between the proportions among the following groups who have participated in educational activities
  (formal or non-formal) in the last 12 months or 4 weeks:

  - Women and men between 18 and 64 years of age (in the last 12 months)
  - People between 18 and 64 years of age belonging to households in the lowest and highest income brackets 
    (in the last 12 months)
  - People between 18 and 64 years of age with and without limitations due to health problems (serious or non-serious) 
    (in the last 12 months)
  - People between 15 and 64 years of age residing in municipalities with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants and more 
    than 10,000 inhabitants (in the last 4 weeks)


formula: |

  $$IPD = \frac{[Ind_i]_d}{[Ind_i]_a}$$

  where:

  $IPD$ = Parity Index in dimension (Sex, Wealth, Location, etc.)

  $Ind_i$ = Education Index: participation in educational activities (formal or informal) 
  in last 12 months or 4 weeks

  $d$ = Disadvantaged group (women, poorer people, people living in small towns, people 
  with limitations due to health problems)

  $a$ = Favored group (men, wealthier people, people living in large municipalities,
  people without health limitations)

  The reference value for this indicator is 1, which indicates absolute parity. 
  The degree of disparity is greater the further the indicator value is from 1, reflecting 
  an unfavorable or favorable situation for the numerator population group relative to the 
  denominator population group, depending on whether the value is lower or higher than 1, 
  respectively.

  To measure the general level of disparity between two sub-populations of interest 
  with regard to a given indicator. The further from 1 the parity index lies, the greater 
  the disparity between the two groups of interest.
