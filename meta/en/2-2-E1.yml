  where:

  $PPO_{>18}^{t} =$ adult population with obesity (BMI>=30) in the year $t$

  $P_{>18}^{t} =$ adult population in the year $t$

justificacion_global: |

  Although the EU has largely overcome hunger problems, new nutrition-related 
  challenges are emerging, such as rising obesity.

  Therefore, the European indicator measures obesity in adulthood and is used 
  to monitor progress towards SDG 2 (ending hunger and malnutrition) and SDG 3 
  (good health and well-being), which are included in the European Commission's 
  priorities within the framework of the "European Green Deal," "An economy that 
  works for people," and "Promoting our European way of life."

  The EU's food policy includes nutrition initiatives and works with EU Member 
  States on various public health initiatives in the areas of nutrition and physical 
  activity to promote a healthy and balanced lifestyle.
