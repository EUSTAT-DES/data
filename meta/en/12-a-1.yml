  The infrastructure and technologies required to supply modern 
  and sustainable energy services cover a wide range of equipment 
  and devices that are used across numerous economic sectors. There 
  is no readily available mechanism to collect, aggregate and measure 
  the contribution of this disparate group of products to the delivery 
  of modern and sustainable energy services. 
 
  However, one major part of the energy supply chain that can be readily 
  measured is the infrastructure used to produce electricity. 

  Renewables are considered a sustainable form of energy supply, as their 
  current use does not usually deplete their availability to be used in 
  the future. The focus of this indicator on electricity reflects the 
  emphasis of the target on modern sources of energy and is particularly 
  relevant for developing countries where the demand for electricity is often 
  high and its availability is constrained. 

  Furthermore, the focus on renewables reflects the fact that the technologies 
  used to produce renewable electricity are generally modern and more 
  sustainable than non-renewables, particularly in the fastest growing sub-sectors 
  of electricity generation from wind and solar energy. 

  The division of renewable electricity capacity by population (to produce a 
  measure of Watts per capita) is proposing to scale the capacity data to account 
  for the large variation in needs between countries. It uses population rather 
  than GDP to scale the data, because this is the most basic indicator of the 
  demand for modern and sustainable energy services in a country. 

  This indicator should also complement indicators 7.1.1 and 7.2.1. With respect 
  to electricity access, it will provide additional information to the proportion 
  of people with electricity access by showing how much infrastructure is available 
  to deliver that access (in terms of the amount of capacity per person). The focus 
  on renewable capacity will also add value to the existing renewables indicator 
  (7.2.1) by showing how much renewable energy is contributing to the need for 
  improved electricity access.
