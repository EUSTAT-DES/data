definicion:
  Area of ​​green cover (forests, grasslands and croplands) in mountain areas relative to 
  the total area of ​​mountain areas 


formula: |

  $$PSMV^{t} = \frac{SMV^{t}}{SM^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $SMV^{t} =$ area of ​​mountain areas covered by forests, grasslands and croplands in year $t$

  $SM^{t} =$ area of ​​mountain areas in year $t$

justificacion_global: |
  Mountain ecosystems are important biodiversity centres that provide valuable ecosystem services to 
  upstream and downstream areas. Yet, mountains are very fragile and impacted easily by both natural and 
  anthropogenic factors. These can include climate change, unplanned agricultural expansion, unplanned 
  urbanization, timber extraction, recreational activities and natural hazards such as landslides and flooding. 

  The degradation of mountain ecosystems such as loss of the glacial cover, mountain biodiversity and green 
  cover will affect the ability of the ecosystem to supply water downstream. The loss of forest and vegetative 
  cover will reduce the ability of the ecosystem to retain soil and prevent landslides and flooding 
  downstream.
