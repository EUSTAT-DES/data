justificacion_global: | 

  The nature of the housing sector with its institutions, laws and regulations, 
  is one that touches every single aspect of the economy of a country and has 
  interface with practically every social development sector. 

  People living in adequate homes have better health, higher chances to improve 
  their human capital and seize the opportunities available in urban contexts. 
  At the same time, a housing sector that performs well acts as a ‘development 
  multiplier’ benefiting complementary industries, contributing to economic 
  development, employment generation, service provision and overall poverty reduction.
