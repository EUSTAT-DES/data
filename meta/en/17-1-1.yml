  Total consolidated revenue of the Basque public administrations as a proportion of GDP at current prices

formula: |

  $$PPIBIAP^{t} = \frac{ICN_{CCAA+EELL}^{t}}{PIB_{CCAA}^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $ICN_{CCAA+EELL}^{t} =$ consolidated revenue of the Basque public administrations in year $t$

  $PIB_{CCAA}^{t} =$ gross domestic product of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country at current prices in year $t$

  <br>

  For territorial disaggregations this formula is used:

  $$PPIBIEL^{t} = \frac{IN_{EELL}^{t}}{PIB_{TH}^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $IN_{EELL}^{t} =$ net income of local entities of a province in year $t$

  $PIB_{TH}^{t} =$ gross domestic product of a province at current prices in year $t$

desagregacion: |

  Province

observaciones: |
  The consolidated income of the Basque administrations is obtained by adding the income of the autonomous 
  community and local entities, subtracting the transfers between them (both current and capital), to avoid 
  double counting. 

  The territorialized indicators for Araba/Álava, Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa correspond to the data of the local 
  entities of each province, without including the income of the autonomous administration or consolidation 
  of transfers.

justificacion_global: |
  Fiscal policy is the use of the level and composition of the general government and public sectors’ 
  spending and revenue—and the related accumulation of government assets and liabilities—to achieve 
  such goals as the stabilization of the economy, the reallocation of resources, and the redistribution of 
  income. 

  In addition to revenue mobilization, government units may also finance a portion of their 
  activities in a specific period by borrowing or by acquiring funds from sources other than compulsory 
  transfers—for example, interest revenue, incidental sales of goods and services, or the rent of subsoil 
  assets. 

  Indicator 17.1.1 Total government revenue as a proportion of GDP, by source supports 
  understanding countries’ domestic revenue mobilization in the form of tax and non-tax sources. The 
  indicator will provide analysts with a cross-country comparable dataset that highlights the relationship 
  between the four main types of revenue as well as the relative "tax burden" (revenue in the form of 
  taxes) and “fiscal burden” (revenue in the form of taxes plus social contributions).
