 # Metadatos mundiales (Descripción del indicador)  


justificacion_global: |
  ICT skills determine the effective use of information and communication technology, so this indicator 
  may therefore assist in making the link between ICT usage and impact. The lack of such skills continues to 
  be one of the key barriers keeping people from fully benefitting from the potential of information and 
  communication technologies. 

  These data may be used to inform targeted policies to improve ICT skills, and thus contribute to an 
  inclusive information society. This is also a core indicator of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for 
  Development's Core List of Indicators, which has been endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission (in 2020).
