  Missing Migrants Project (MMP) data bears witness to the ongoing 
  global crisis of deaths during migration and is the only global 
  database on this topic. It is hoped that by counting and accounting 
  for these deaths, almost all of which are linked to irregular migration, 
  policymakers, academics, and the general public will be better informed 
  about the risks linked to unsafe migration. 

  While data by itself might not bring about change, it can provide the 
  necessary evidence to prompt action. However, it is likely that the data 
  currently available is a vast undercount of the true number of lives lost 
  during migration.
