justificacion_global: | 

  This indicator provides valuable information that could be used to formulate policies 
  and programmes for the prevention of occupational injuries, diseases and deaths. 
  It could also be used to monitor the implementation of these programmes and to signal 
  particular areas of increasing risk such as a particular occupation, industry or location. 
  Although the principal objective of this indicator is to provide information for prevention 
  purposes, it may be used for a number of other purposes, such as to identify the occupations 
  and economic activities with the highest risk of occupational injuries; to detect changes 
  in the pattern and occurrence of occupational injuries, so as to monitor improvements in safety 
  and reveal any new areas of risk; to inform employers, employers’ organizations, workers and 
  workers’ organizations of the risks associated with their work and workplaces, so that they can 
  take an active part in their own safety; to evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures; 
  to estimate the consequences of occupational injuries, particularly in terms of days lost or costs; 
  and to provide a basis for policymaking aimed at encouraging employers, employers’ organizations, 
  workers and workers’ organizations to introduce accident prevention measures.
