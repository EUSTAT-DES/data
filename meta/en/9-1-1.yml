definicion: >- 
  The indicator (commonly known as the Rural Access Index or RAI) measures the share of a country’s rural 
  population that lives within 2 km of an all-season road.

formula:  |

  $$IAR^{t} = \frac{PR_{all\, season\, road}^{t}}{PR^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $PR_{all\, season\, road}^{t} =$ rural population that lives within 2 km of an all-season road in year $t$

  $PR^{t} =$ rural population in year $t$

  The Rural Access Index (RAI), originally developed by the World Bank in 2006, is among the most 
  important global development indicators in the transport sector, providing a strong, clearly 
  understandable and conceptually consistent indicator across countries. It measures the proportion of 
  people living in rural areas who have access to an all-season road within a walking distance of 
  approximately 2 kilometres (km). 

  Among other factors, transport connectivity is an essential part of the enabling environment for inclusive 
  and sustained growth. In developing countries, particularly in Africa, the vast majority of agricultural 
  production remains smallholder farming with limited access to local, regional, or global markets. 

  Isolated manufacturing and other local businesses (except for those related to mining) often lag behind 
  in the   global market. Limited transport connectivity is also a critical constraint to accessing social 
  and administrative services, especially in rural areas where the majority of the poor live. 

  Rural access is key to unleashing untapped economic potential and eradicating poverty in many 
  developing countries. In the short term, transport costs and travel time can be reduced by improved road 
  conditions. Over the longer term, agricultural productivity will be increased, and firms will become more 
  profitable with the creation of more jobs, eventually helping to alleviate poverty.
