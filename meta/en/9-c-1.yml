definicion:  |
  
  Proportion of households covered by third generation (3G) mobile networks based on the UMTS 
  (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) standard and equipped with HSPA (High Speed 
  Packet Access), also known as 3.5G, by LTE (Long Term Evolution) mobile networks, also known 
  as 4G, or by 5G mobile networks


formula:  |

  $$PHRM^{t} = \frac{HRM_{technology}^{t}}{HRM^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $HRM_{technology}^{t} =$ households covered by mobile networks in the year $t$

  $HRM^{t} =$ households in year $t$

justificacion_global: | 

  The percentage of the population covered by a mobile cellular network can be 
  considered as a minimum indicator for Information and Communication Technology 
  (ICT) access since it provides people with the possibility to subscribe to and 
  use mobile-cellular services to communicate. 

  Over the last decade, mobilecellular networks have expanded rapidly and helped 
  overcome very basic infrastructure barriers that existed when fixed-telephone 
  networks – often limited to urban and highly populated areas - were the dominant 
  telecommunication infrastructure. 

  While 2G (narrowband) mobile-cellular networks offer limited (and mainly voice-based) 
  services, higherspeed networks (3G and LTE and above) provide increasingly high-speed, 
  reliable and high-quality access to the Internet and its increasing amount of information, 
  content, services, and applications. 

  Mobile networks are therefore essential to overcoming infrastructure barriers, helping 
  people join the information society and benefit from the potential of ICTs, in particular 
  in least developed countries. 

  The indicator highlights the importance of mobile networks in providing basic, as well 
  as advanced communication services and will help design targeted policies to overcome 
  remaining infrastructure barriers, and address the digital divide. Many governments 
  track this indicator and have set specific targets in terms of the mobile population 
  coverage (by technology) that operators must achieve.
