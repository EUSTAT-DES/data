justificacion_global: | 

  Labour share of GDP seeks to inform about the relative share of GDP which 
  accrues to workers as compared to the share which accrues to capital in a 
  given reference period. 

  In order to interpret this indicator effectively, it is important to consider 
  it together with economic growth trends. The share of labour compensation in 
  national output can highlight the extent to which economic growth translates 
  into higher incomes for employees over time (and/or higher earnings for the 
  self-employed). In periods of economic recession, the labour income share provides 
  an indication of the extent to which falling output reduces labour income relative 
  to profits. 

  If labour income falls at a greater rate than profits, the labour income share will 
  be expected to fall. By contrast, if there is a sharper decline in profits than in 
  labour income, the share will rise. 

  For any given level of GDP and profits, the labour income share can fall as a result 
  of falling wages, falling earnings of the self-employed, changes in the composition 
  of employment by income or a combination of these. 

  Increased production and GDP often lead to improved living standards of individuals 
  in the economy, but this will depend on the distribution of real income and public 
  policy among other factors.
