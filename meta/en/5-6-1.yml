  Women’s and girls’ autonomy in decision-making about sexual and reproductive health services, 
  contraceptive use, and consensual sexual relations is key to their empowerment and the complete 
  exercise of their reproductive rights. 

  Women who make their own decision regarding seeking healthcare for themselves are considered 
  empowered to exercise their reproductive rights. Regarding decision-making on the use of contraception, 
  a clearer understanding of women empowerment is obtained by looking at the indicator from the perspective 
  of decisions being made “mainly by the partner”, as opposed to a decision being made “by the woman alone” 
  or “by the woman jointly with the partner”. 

  Depending on the type of contraceptive method being used, a decision by the woman “alone” or “jointly 
  with the partner” does not always entail that the woman is empowered or has bargaining skills. 
  Conversely, it is safe to assume that a woman that does not participate, at all, in making contraceptive 
  choices is disempowered as far as sexual and reproductive decisions are concerned. A woman’s ability to 
  say no to her husband/partner if she does not want to have sexual intercourse is well aligned with the 
  concept of sexual autonomy and women’s empowerment.
