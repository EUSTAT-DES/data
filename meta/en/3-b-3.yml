  Measurement and monitoring of access to essential medicines are of high 
  priority for the global development agenda given access is an integral part 
  of the Universal Health Coverage movement and an indispensable element of 
  the delivery of quality health care. 

  Access to medicines is a composite multidimensional concept that is composed 
  of the availability of medicines and the affordability of their prices. Information 
  on these two dimensions has been collected and analysed since the 54th World Health 
  Assembly in 2001, when Member States adopted the WHO Medicines Strategy (resolution 
  WHA54.11).

  This resolution led to the launch of the joint project on Medicine Prices and 
  Availability by WHO and the international non-governmental organization Health 
  Action International (HAI/WHO), as well as a proposed HAI/WHO methodology for 
  collecting data and measuring components of access to medicines. 

  To this day, this methodology has been widely implemented to produce useful 
  analyses of availability and affordability of medicines, however the two dimensions 
  have been evaluated separately.
