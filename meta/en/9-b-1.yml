definicion: >- 
  Proportion of gross value added of the manufacturing sector corresponding to medium-high and high technology activities

formula:  |

  $$PVAB_{manufacturing\, medium-high\, and\, high}^{t} = \frac{VAB_{manufacturing\, medium-high\, and\, high}^{t}}{VAB_{manufacturing}^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $VAB_{manufacturing\, medium-high\, and\, high}^{t} $ = gross value added of the manufacturing sector corresponding to medium-high and high technology activities in year $t$

  $VAB_{manufacturing}^{t} $ = gross value added of the manufacturing sector in year $t$

justificacion_global: | 

  Industrial development generally entails a structural transition from resource-based and low technology 
  activities to MHT manufacturing activities. 

  A modern, highly complex production structure offers better opportunities for skills development 
  and technological innovation. MHT activities generally correspond to the industries with higher 
  value addition and labour productivity. Increasing the share of MHT sectors also reflects the 
  impact of innovation.
