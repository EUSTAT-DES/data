  The new Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI) replaces the Statistical Capacity Index (SCI), which the 
  World Bank has regularly published since 2004. Although the goals are the same, to offer a better tool to 
  measure the statistical systems of countries, the new SPI framework has expanded into new areas 
  including data use, administrative data, geospatial data, data services, and data infrastructure. The SPI 
  provides a framework that can help countries measure where they stand in several dimensions and offers 
  an ambitious measurement agenda for the international community. 

  The data sources overall score (Pillar 4 score) is a composite measure of whether countries have data 
  available from the following sources: Censuses and surveys, administrative data and geospatial data. The 
  data sources (input) pillar is segmented by the following sources generated by (i) the statistical office 
  (censuses and surveys), and sources accessed from elsewhere such as (ii) administrative data, and (iii) 
  geospatial data. The appropriate balance between these source types will vary depending on a 
  country’s institutional setting and the maturity of its statistical system. 

  High scores should reflect the 
  extent to which the sources being utilized enable the necessary statistical indicators to be generated. For 
  example, a low score on environment statistics (in the data production pillar) may reflect a lack of use of 
  (and low score for) geospatial data (in the data sources pillar). 

  On the other hand, The Open Data Inventory (ODIN) Coverage Index is an indicator of a country’s capacity to produce a set of 
  official statistics across 22 categories from national databases to support the SDGs. 

  Computing the total
  index across the five elements for each of the 22 data categories allows for an assessment of the 
  country’s revealed capacity to produce data that are important for national, regional, and global 
  development efforts.
