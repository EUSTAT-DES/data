justificacion_global: | 

  Mainstreaming sustainable consumption and production in decision-making at all 
  levels is a core function of the 10-Year Framework, which is expected to “support 
  the integration of sustainable consumption and production into sustainable development 
  policies, programmes and strategies, as appropriate, including, where applicable, 
  into poverty reduction strategies” (Rio+20 Outcome Document – A/CONF.216/5). 

  The purpose of this indicator is to help assess the volume and geographical 
  repartition of governments progressing on sustainable consumption and production. 
  In addition, further information is being collected on the types, focus and 
  orientation of the policy instruments that are being developed and used, to monitor 
  their progression over time as well as their contribution to other Sustainable 
  Development Goals. 

  This should support evaluation of how much / how fast governments progress in the 
  development and application of policies addressing sustainable consumption and 
  production, whether at cross-cutting or sectoral level. The indicator is also 
  considering both binding (laws and regulations) and non-binding policy instruments. 

  The first category is essential to the shift, as binding instruments provide the 
  legal ground for sustainable consumption and production, and can be used for 
  enforcement or to provide incentives. The ability to develop, pass and implement 
  legislation is an indication of jurisdictions’ engagement in the shift towards 
  sustainable consumption and production. This indicator can also help monitor the 
  evolution of the global legislative landscape. 

  The second category is also essential to ensure institutional engagement, commitment 
  and ownership. In some cases, non-binding policy instruments can lead to the creation 
  of new legal ones. The development and implementation of non-binding instruments across 
  sectors also provides information on engagement of partners and other stakeholders in 
  sustainable consumption and production.
