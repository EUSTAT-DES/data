  Proportion of teachers at different educational levels who have received 
  at least the minimum teacher training, organized prior to employment or on-the-job, 
  required to teach at that level, out of the total number of teachers at that 
  educational level

formula: |

  $$PPRFD_{educational\, level}^{t} = \frac{PRFD_{educational\, level}^{t}}{PR^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $PRFD_{educational\, level}^{t} =$ teachers of the educational level with teacher training in the school year $t-1/t$

  $CENU^{t} =$ total number of teachers at the educational level in the school year $t-1/t$

justificacion_global: |
  Teachers play a key role in ensuring the quality of education provided. Ideally all 
  teachers should receive adequate, appropriate and relevant pedagogical training to 
  teach at the chosen level of education and be academically well-qualified in the subject(s) 
  they are expected to teach. 

  This indicator measures the share of the teaching work force which is pedagogically 
  well-trained. A high value indicates that students are being taught by teachers who 
  are pedagogically well-trained to teach.
