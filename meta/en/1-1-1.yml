definicion: >- 
  Proportion of people whose net equivalent income, after social transfers, 
  is below the international poverty line of USD2.15 
  in purchasing power parity (PPP) of 2017.

formula: |

  $$PP_{IPL}^{t} = \frac{P_{IPL}^{t}}{P^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $P_{IPL}^{t} =$ population with net equivalent income below the international poverty line, in year $t$

  $P^{t} =$ total population in year $t$

  To account for the impact of differences in household size and composition, 
  a household's disposable income is divided by the number of household members converted to adult 
  equivalents (units of consumption).

  The number of consumption units in a household 
  is calculated using the modified OECD scale, which assigns a weight of 1 to the 
  first person aged 14 or over, a weight of 0.5 for other people aged 14 or over 
  and a weight of 0.3 for people under 14 years of age.

  Poverty lines vary according to the purchasing power of countries and 
  have a strong economic gradient, so that the richest countries 
  tend to adopt higher standards of living to define poverty.

  However, to consistently measure global absolute poverty in 
  terms of consumption, it is necessary to treat two people with the same 
  purchasing power over basic goods in the same way —both are poor or not poor— 
  even if they live in different countries.

  Since the 1990 World Development Report, the World Bank has 
  proposed to apply a common standard to measure extreme poverty, based on 
  on what poverty means in the poorest countries of the world. The 
  well-being of people living in different countries can be measured in 
  a common scale adjusting for differences in the purchasing power of the 
  currencies.

  The commonly used standard of USD1 a day, measured at 1985 prices 
  and adjusted to the local currency using rates 
  of purchasing power parity (PPP), was chosen for the 
  World Development Report of 1990 because it was typical of the 
  poverty lines in low-income countries at the time. Bespoke 
  that differences in the cost of living are evolving worldwide, the 
  International Poverty Line must be updated regularly 
  using new PPP price data to reflect these changes. 
  The last change occurred in September 2022, when the World Bank 
  adopted USD2.15 as international poverty line 
  using the 2017 PPP.
