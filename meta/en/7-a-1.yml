  Total Official Development Assistance (ODA) and Other Official flows (OOF) 
  to developing countries quantify the public financial effort (excluding export 
  credits) that donors provide to developing countries for renewable energies. 
  The additional flows (from the IRENA database) capture the flows to non-ODA 
  Recipients in developing regions, flows from countries and institutions not 
  currently reporting to the DAC and certain other types of flows, such as export 
  credits. 

  Energy access is a major development constraint in many developing countries and, 
  while starting from a relatively low base, energy demand is expected to grow very 
  rapidly in many of these countries in the future. This presents an opportunity for 
  developing countries to utilize clean and renewable technologies to meet their future 
  energy needs if they can gain access to the appropriate technologies and expertise. 

  This indicator provides a suitable measure of the international support given to 
  developing countries to access these technologies.
