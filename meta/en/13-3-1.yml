  In order to achieve SDG targets 4.7, 12.8 and 13.3, it is necessary for 
  governments to ensure that ESD and GCED and their sub-themes are fully 
  integrated in all aspects of their education systems. 

  Students will not achieve the desired learning outcomes if Education for Sustainable Development 
  (ESD) and Global Citizenship Education (GCED) have not been identified as 
  priorities in education policies or laws, if curricula do not specifically 
  include the themes and sub-themes of ESD and GCED, and if teachers are not 
  trained to teach these topics across the curriculum. 

  This indicator aims to give a simple assessment of whether the basic 
  infrastructure exists that would allow countries to deliver quality ESD and 
  GCED to learners, to ensure their populations have adequate information on 
  sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature. Appropriate 
  education policies, curricula, teacher education, and student assessment are 
  key aspects of national commitment and effort to implement GCED and ESD effectively 
  and to provide a conducive learning environment.
