  The pledge to leave no-one behind and eliminate discrimination is at the 
  centre of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The elimination of 
  discrimination is also enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
  and the core international human rights treaties. 

  The purpose of this indicator is to measure a prevalence of discrimination 
  based on the personal experience reported by individuals. It is considered 
  an outcome indicator helping to measure the effectiveness of non-discriminatory 
  laws, policy and practices for the concerned population groups. 

  The international human rights normative framework identifies a list of grounds 
  that includes race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
  national origin, social origin, property, birth status, disability, age, nationality, 
  marital and family status, sexual orientation, gender identity, health status, 
  place of residence, economic and social situation, pregnancy, indigenous status, 
  afro-descent and other status.

  In practice, it will be difficult to include all potentially relevant grounds of 
  discrimination in household survey questions. For this reason, it is recommended 
  that data collectors identify contextually relevant and feasible lists of grounds.
