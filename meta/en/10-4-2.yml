definicion: | 

  The Gini index measures the statistical dispersion in income distribution 
  within a population. It is used to compare inequality in income distribution 
  across different territories. 

  Its value is between 0 and 100, so the closer it is to 100, the greater the 
  concentration of income, and the closer it is to 0, the more equitable the 
  distribution of wealth. 


formula: |

  $$I^{t}_{GINI} = \frac{A^t}{(A + B)^t}$$

  where:

  $A^{t} =$ Area over the Lorenz curve in the year $t$

  $B^{t} =$ Area under the Lorenz curve in the year $t$

  The Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator demonstrates in an 
  accounting framework the total amount by which current income inequality 
  is reduced or increased by the current execution of fiscal policy (including 
  direct and indirect taxes; social insurance and old-age pension contributions; 
  direct cash or near-cash transfers; and subsidies). 

  For example, if the Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy is positive, that 
  indicates that the net effect of Fiscal Policy is to reduce the Gini index from 
  what it otherwise would be without Fiscal Policy (in an accounting sense, not 
  as an economic counterfactual). 

  The indicator allows policy makers and the broader stakeholder and advocacy 
  communities to systematically track progress at the country level in the 
  contribution of fiscal policy to more equitable societies.
