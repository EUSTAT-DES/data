observaciones:

  It should be noted that the breakdown by autonomous communities of the number of people who have been 
  granted refugee status or a similar international protection status in Spain is not carried out by 
  place of residence, but by the place where the administrative procedure that gave rise to that status 
  was carried out.

  The calculation of this indicator will allow observing on how many products Developing countries and 
  LDCs will have free access to Developed countries markets. When compared to the tariff rates applied to 
  other countries, this indicator will allow assessing to which extent special and differential treatment has 
  been accorded in terms of import tariffs. 

  The evolution of this indicator will indicate progress on the 
  phasing out of tariff rates on goods coming from Developing and LDCs.
