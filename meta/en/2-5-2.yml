  The indicator has a direct link to “biodiversity” as animal or livestock 
  genetic resources represent an integral part of agricultural ecosystems and 
  biodiversity as such. Further there are indirect links to “malnutrition”: 
  Animal genetic resources for food and agriculture are an essential part of 
  the biological basis for world food security, and contribute to the livelihoods 
  of over a thousand million people.

  A diverse resource base is critical for human survival and well-being, and a 
  contribution to the eradication of hunger: animal genetic resources are crucial 
  in adapting to changing socio-economic and environmental conditions, including 
  climate change.

  They are the animal breeder’s raw material and amongst the farmer’s most essential 
  inputs. They are essential for sustainable agricultural production. No increase of 
  the percentage of breeds being at risk or being extinct is directly related to “halt 
  the loss of biodiversity”.
