  Industrial enterprises are classified to small compared to large or medium for their distinct 
  nature of economic organization, production capability, scale of investment and other economic 
  characteristics. 

  “Small-scale industries” can be run with a small amount of capital, relatively unskilled labor 
  and using local materials. Despite their small contribution to total industrial output, their 
  role in job creation, especially in developing countries is recognized to be significant where 
  the scope of absorbing surplus labor force from traditional sectors such as agriculture or fishery 
  is very high. 

  “Small-scale industries” are capable of meeting domestic demand of basic consumer goods such as food, 
  clothes, furniture, etc. Thus “small-scale industries” play an important role in the economy. 
  However, it has quite limited access to financial services, especially in developing countries. 

  In order to improve the skill of workers and technology for production, small-scale industrial 
  enterprises require financial support in the form of preferential loan, credit etc. This indicator 
  shows how widely financial institutions are serving the “smallscale industries”. Together with the 
  indicator SDG 9.3.1, this indicator reflects the main message of the target 9.3 which seeks to 
  increase the access of “small-scale industries” to financial services.
