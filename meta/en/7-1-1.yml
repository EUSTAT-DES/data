definicion: |

  Percentage of population with access to consistent sources of electricity

formula: |

  $$PA_{electricity}^{t} = \frac{PA_{electricity}^{t}}{P^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where:

  $PA_{electricity}^{t} =$ population with access to electricity in year $t$

  $P^{t} =$ population in year $t$

  Access to electricity addresses major critical issues in all the 
  dimensions of sustainable development. The target has a wide range 
  of social and economic impacts, including facilitating development 
  of income generating activities and lightening the burden of household 
  tasks.

  Under the global target of equal access to energy, SDG7.1.1 focuses 
  specifically on electricity access available to the global population. 
  In order to gain a clear picture, access rates are only considered if the 
  primary source of lighting is the local electricity provider, solar 
  systems, mini-grids and stand-alone systems. 

  Sources such as generators, candles, batteries, etc., are not considered 
  due to their limited working capacities and since they are usually kept 
  as backup sources for lighting.
