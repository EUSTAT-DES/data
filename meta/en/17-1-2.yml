  Available series: 

   - Proportion of non-financial income of the Basque public administrations that comes from taxes

   - Proportion of total income of the Basque public administrations that comes from taxes
  
formula: |

  <b>Proportion of non-financial income that comes from taxes</b>

  $$PI_{tax}^{t} = \frac{I_{tax}^{t}}{I_{non\_fin}^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where: 

  $I_{tax}^{t}$ = direct and indirect tax revenues of the Autonomous Community and Local Entities in year $t$ 

  $I_{non_fin}^{t}$ = consolidated non-financial income of the Autonomous Community and Local Entitites in year $t$ (chapters 1 to 5, eliminating internal transfers between administrations)

  <b>Proportion of total income of the Basque public administrations that comes from taxes</b>

  $$PIT_{tax}^{t} = \frac{I_{tax}^{t}}{I_{tot}^{t}} \cdot 100$$

  where: 

  $I_{imp}^{t}$ = direct and indirect tax revenues of the Autonomous Community and Local Entities in year $t$

  $I_{tot}^{t}$ = consolidated non-financial income of the Autonomous Community and Local Entitites in year $t$ (chapters 1 to 9, eliminating internal transfers between administrations)


desagregacion:

observaciones: |

  The consolidated data on the budget settlements of the autonomous communities are taken after being filtered 
  from the IFL (Local Financial Intermediation) and CAP (Common Agricultural Policy). 

  In the first series, tax revenues are considered to be those included in Chapters 1 (direct taxes) and 2 
  (indirect taxes) of the economic classification. Non-financial revenues correspond to Chapters 1 to 5. Double 
  counting of transfers between the autonomous community and local entities is eliminated. 

  La segunda serie incluye tanto los ingresos no financieros como los financieros (capítulo 9). También 
  se consolidan las transferencias internas para evitar duplicidades.

  Indicator 17.1.2, Proportion of domestic budgetary central government expenditure funded by taxes, 
  supports an understanding of the extent to which countries’ recurrent and capital outlays are actually 
  covered by domestic revenue mobilization in the form of taxation. 

  The indicator, which can be directly derived from GFS series reported by national authorities to the 
  IMF Statistics Department, will provide analysts with a cross-country comparable dataset that highlights 
  the relationship between the executed national budget and the revenue/tax administration.

  The available indicator does not comply with the United Nations metadata, but provides complementary information. 
  While the United Nations indicator relates tax revenue to total public spending, the Basque Country indicator measures 
  the proportion of the total consolidated revenue of the Basque public administrations that comes from taxes. Therefore, 
  it focuses on the financing structure of the Basque public sector and not on its budget execution.
